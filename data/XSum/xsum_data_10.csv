Golds for Aaron Cook, Michael Harvey and Lutalo Muhammad earlier in the event meant GB finished top of the male medal standings and as the second best nation overall in Manchester.
""I'm delighted, it's been a fantastic week,"" boss Gary Hall told BBC Sport.
""They performed out of their skins.""
I just did the wrong thing and got kicked in the face a few too many times
The Great Britain performance director added: ""To set a new British record is a brilliant performance by the athletes and all of the staff.
""We set out to beat the Turks as they hadn't lost in 20 years and so to get the number one slot for the men was phenomenal.""
The next task for Hall is to select the four athletes he wishes to take to the London 2012 Olympics.
Cook will be expected to take the -80kg place, but the men's other Olympic class, the -68kg division, is tougher to call.
Stamper was in pole position after a stunning 2011, which culminated in a World Championship bronze medal, but his failure to reach the final in Manchester, coupled with rival Harvey securing -63kg gold, could affect selection.
""I knew I had the capabilities to win it, so I'm disappointed,"" reflected Stamper.
""I'm confident [about selection], as all of my medals have been in the -68kg's [Olympic class]. Take nothing away from Mike [Harvey] he's done amazingly well, but it's in the division below.
""I would have loved to get into the final because then I would have been going, but now it's up to the selectors,"" said Stamper.
Hall admitted the women's team still have a ""little bit to go"" after collecting two bronze medals.
Fisher, who trains outside of the GB programme, was disappointed at failing to reach the -53kg final, which probably rules the 29-year-old out of challenging Jade Jones for the London 2012 -57kg place.
""Everyone wants that shot at being 'the athlete' and obviously a gold today would have been better than a bronze, but it didn't happen,"" said a tearful Fisher.
""Hopefully I can support Jade if she gets picked.""
Liverpool's Bianca Walkden was the GB fighter in the women's -67kg division, but she crashed out in the quarter-finals with a heavy 22-16 defeat to Petra Matijasevic of Croatia.
With world champion Sarah Stevenson said to be recovering ""ahead of schedule"" following a knee ligament injury earlier this year, Walkden fears that failing to win a medal means her chances of selection are over.
""Obviously it was a big championships and it was the one before the Olympics and I know I should be up there, I just did the wrong thing and got kicked in the face a few too many times,"" said a clearly upset Walkden.
""I just have to sit back and pray that I can get in on my performance because I gave it everything that I've got.""
Great Britain will formally reveal their four Olympic athletes and four reserve fighters for the London 2012 Olympics on Friday 24 May.","Great Britain's taekwondo team secured their best medal haul at a European Championships, with seven in all, as Martin Stamper and Caroline Fisher won bronzes on the final day."

But his zest for life and inspiring charity work, which has now seen him raise more than £1m, continues to drive him on.
And a unique rehabilitation centre treating people with catastrophic injuries which is under construction and set to be opened in September means many more will benefit in the years to come.
The Get Busy Living Centre near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire will see Hampson's long-term dream become a reality.
Hampson, now 32, told BBC East Midlands Today: ""To see something tangible for the Foundation and for our beneficiaries to come along to, and to be able to offer them a place for home, a purpose, is so, so important.
""We'd spoken about it on numerous occasions, how we wanted to build a centre and things have moved on so quickly. Now it's actually a physical building it's pretty impressive.""
Former Leicester Tigers and England youth international Hampson was injured when a scrum collapsed while training with the England Under-21 squad in 2005 and he can only breathe with the help of a ventilator.
But he set up the Matt Hampson Foundation when he came out of hospital which has already helped hundreds of people in similar situations. The Get Busy Living Centre is the next step.
""When I left hospital I got stuck in a rut and didn't really have a purpose and didn't know what to do with the rest of my life,"" Hampson explained.
""I was very lucky to have a foundation to channel my energy in, to to do something purposeful, but a lot of people haven't got that purpose and that light at the end of the tunnel. This building will offer that help and purpose.""
The £1m total has been reached since the Foundation was given charitable status in 2011.
Now the Foundation is laying foundations of a different kind at a derelict old aircraft hanger at Burrough on the Hill.
The site is being transformed into a state-of-the-art facility where beneficiaries will be able to receive physical rehabilitation, spend time with their families and share experiences.
The project has been made possible thanks to a number of local firms and construction companies, many of whom have offered their time services and expertise for free.
And Hampson has an impressive list of stars who have lent their support in all sorts of ways, including ex-England rugby union stars Martin Johnson, Johnny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Austin Healey, Leicester centre Manu Tuilagi and England cricketer Stuart Broad.
Former England captain and 2003 World Cup winner Tindall, who is patron of the Matt Hampson Foundation, said the new facility will provide a complete service and that Hampson's journey and charitable work remains a huge inspiration.
""I'm in awe of him in terms of how he's coped with the cards he's been dealt and how he's spurred others on,"" Tindall said. ""He doesn't let anything stop him.
""I don't think there's many places out there that are able to provide not just the physio side, the exercise side, maximising that, but also the community side.
""That's one of the main goals of the centre, to pull families in, because I think people forget about that, how hard it becomes for them. It's not just the beneficiaries. Families get confused, they don't understand where's the best place to go to help, what should they be doing?
""Everyone talks about mental health nowadays, bottling things up, being able to have that outlet. Here you are going to naturally create that and I think that will benefit everyone.""
Roy Jackson, chairman of the Trustees at the Matt Hampson Foundation, added: ""It's always been Matt's dream since his accident to do things for other people. This Get Busy Living centre is going to supply that need.
""It's been nothing but a building site since October, and now to go up there and see the steel up, to walk in, you can actually feel what's going to happen in that building.
""It will be a fantastic place for Matt to continue to inspire people, and realise there is life after a spinal injury.
""I know we've helped over 100 beneficiaries and we've donated more than a million pounds and that will increase when the centre opens. But it's not just the cash. We do more than that. It's the inspiration Matt gives to people. More than just buying wheelchairs or that sort of thing.""
Natalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor, first interviewed Hampson in hospital 12 years ago, just months after his injury.
""When the accident first happened he couldn't move or speak and only communicate with his eyes,"" she said.
""Matt spent 17 months in hospital and I spent his last week filming with him before he came home. What stood out even in the months after the accident was his awe-inspiring positivity and love for life.
""He was the life and soul in the Spinal Injuries National Centre at Stoke Manderville. Some people had got their injury while tripping or slipping in the shower. Matt said he was lucky that he got the injury doing something he loved and felt the injury would make him a better person.
""He explained being a sports person you need to be very selfish. He said now he sits and listens to people and has more time for them and felt that he now had an opportunity to help others and change lives. He has lived that sentiment every day since and never ceases to amaze me with his incredible attitude and determination to inspire others.""",Matt Hampson's life-changing rugby union injury left him paralysed from the neck down and ended the career he had set his heart on at the age of just 20.
36569410,"Virginia Raggi won 67% of the Rome vote and becomes its first female mayor.
Her victory is a blow to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which won in Milan and Bologna.
The results could give anti-globalisation Five Star a platform for parliamentary elections due in 2018.
Five Star is aiming to establish itself as the main opposition party ahead of the vote, and its success on Sunday extended well beyond Rome. It won in 19 out of 20 towns and cities in which its candidates stood for mayor.
Another female Five Star candidate, Chiara Appendino, won the race for mayor in Turin, defeating a Democratic Party candidate who had come out on top in the first round of voting two weeks ago.
""It was not a vote of protest, but of pride and change, "" she told supporters, promising to rebuilt trust between the people of Turin and its elected representatives.
Ms Appendino's win, although more narrow than in Rome, was a significant step for Five Star because Turin is a big power base for the PD as well as the headquarters of car-maker Fiat.
She defeated Piero Fassino, who had been well ahead after the first round of voting.
In Rome, 37-year-old lawyer Virginia Raggi promised a new era for the city as she celebrated her victory over PD candidate Roberto Giachetti.
""I will be a mayor for all Romans. I will restore legality and transparency to the city's institutions after 20 years of poor governance,"" she said.
Ms Raggi will find a city mired in debts of more than â‚¬13bn (Â£10bn; $15bn) - twice its annual budget. Romans are frustrated by potholes, piles of rubbish and serious deficiencies in public transport and housing, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from the Italian capital.
PD's Ignazio Marino resigned as mayor of Rome in October over an expenses scandal. The city has been without a mayor since then. Five Star's rise in Rome was fuelled by a big scandal involving alleged Mafia influence at Rome city hall.
In Naples, Italy's third city, left-wing former prosecutor Luigi de Magistris won a second term with two thirds of the vote.
Sunday's results were bad news for Prime Minister Renzi, who has staked his political future on an October referendum in which he wants Italians to back far-reaching constitutional reforms.
The plan is to end Italy's tradition of ""revolving-door"" governments and inject stability after years of party infighting and legislative logjams.
When in Rome shake up the politics","The anti-establishment Five Star Movement has won key mayoral races in Italy's capital Rome and Turin, cementing its role in Italian politics."
35943740,"Although there are legitimate ways of using tax havens, most of what has been going on is about hiding the true owners of money, the origin of the money and avoiding paying tax on the money.
If you are a wealthy business owner in Germany who has decided to evade tax, an international drugs dealer or the head of a brutal regime, the methods are all pretty similar.
Mossack Fonseca says it has always complied with international protocols to ensure the companies it incorporates are not used for tax evasion, money-laundering, terrorist finance or other illicit purposes.
A shell company has the outward appearance of being a legitimate business. But it is just an empty shell. It does nothing but manage the money in it, while hiding who owns the money. Its management is made up of lawyers, accountants or even the office cleaner, who do little more than sign documents and allow their names to appear on the letterhead. When the authorities try to find out who really owns or controls the money in the company, they are told the management does, but it is all just a front. Someone else is just paying them so they can hide their money from the authorities or in some cases their ex-wives. Shell companies can also be called ""letterbox"" companies, as they consist of little more than an address to post documents to.
If you have a shell company, you don't want it based in London or Paris where the authorities can normally find out who owns it, if they really want to. You need an Offshore Financial Centre, or what is often called a tax haven. These are normally based in small island countries (hence the name), with a great deal of banking secrecy and very low or non-existent taxes on financial transactions. There are many such countries or authorities around the world, from the British Virgin Islands, to Macao, the Bahamas and Panama. Even in such places most of the financial services are perfectly legal: it is just the secrecy which also makes them very attractive to tax evaders and crooks the world over, especially if the regulators are weak or turning a blind eye.
For that extra layer of anonymity and so that you can move large amounts of money around easily, bearer shares and bonds are an obvious answer. Every British Â£5 note has the words ""I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five pounds"". That means if it is in your pocket it is yours: the person ""bearing"" or carrying the cash owns it, can spend it or do what they like with it. Bearer shares and bonds work in the same way, the person who has it in their pocket, briefcase or safety deposit box owns it. But they aren't worth Â£5. Bearer bonds normally come in nice round figures like Â£10,000. Very handy if you want to move vast amounts of money around and great if you want to deny ownership. If the bond is kept at a lawyer's office in Panama, who is to know whether it is yours, or even that it exists? This helps to explain why the US government stopped selling bearer bonds in 1982. They were just too easy for crooks to use.
Money laundering involves cleaning ""dirty"" money so that you can use it without arousing suspicion. If you are a drug dealer, fraudster or, let's say, a corrupt politician you will have a lot of cash and no way of spending it or hiding it for a rainy day, without giving the game away. The money needs cleaning, so you can ship it to a dodgy firm in an Offshore Financial Centre and they might help you convert it into bearer bonds, owned by a shell company that no one knows about. You could also use it to buy a bolt-hole in London or the South of France in case of a coup, maybe pay the kids' school fees or fund a great aunt's shopping trips to Paris.
One of the ways of punishing and trying to limit the power of notorious regimes around the world is sanctions. These can involve limits on the importation of military equipment or ammunition, bans on the exports of oil and other goods, and personal sanctions; closing the bank accounts of dictators and their friends, families and supporters. The British government currently imposes thousands of sanctions against countries, their businesses, banks and many named individuals.
But the more onerous the sanctions on a regime the more money is to be made by breaking or busting them. Providing secret bank accounts for torturers and mass murderers, supplying weapons to one or even both sides in a civil war or funding the nuclear ambitions of isolated regimes. The profits are huge and, of course, lots of secretive bank accounts and shell companies in parts of the world where officials turn a blind eye, is key to making sanction busting profitable and safe. You can see the list of UK sanctions here.
To try to stop people hiding money from the tax authorities the European Union introduced the European Savings Directive (ESD). Basically, banks in EU countries collect the tax due on bank accounts held by citizens of other EU countries. So you can't be an Irish person with a Dutch bank account and hope the Irish tax authorities won't find out about it or collect the tax owed. The ESD made it much more difficult to hide your money in Europe. It is interesting because when the ESD was being discussed and introduced there was a sudden increase in people who wanted to open bank accounts outside Europe, hence the surge of interest in places like Panama and the British Virgin Islands.",The revelations in the millions of papers leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca uncovering a suspected money laundering ring run by close associates of Vladimir Putin may leave readers drowning in a sea of confusing terms and phrases.
36086987,"He went on to say: ""By being part of that free trade zone we would have full access to the European market but we would be free from EU regulation.""
This may be Michael Gove's hope, but it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to deliver in reality.
Assume ""the European market"" means the countries of the European continent. As Mr Gove says, excluding Russia and Belarus they are all part of a ""free trade area"" of sorts.
However, that is not one homogenous block but a mixture of agreements with varying conditions.
At its heart is the 'single market' of 28 member states of the EU.
Then there is the European Economic Area, a deal between Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and the European Union.
Switzerland has its own bi-lateral agreement with the EU because its people rejected membership of the EEA in a referendum.
Turkey is part of a customs union. Other European states included in Mr Gove's definition, like Ukraine, also have bi-lateral deals with the EU.
All have required concessions from their members in order to do a deal.
The EEA deal with the EU came in on January 1st 1994 and effectively expands the single market to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - we could call this ""full access"".
But in return they accepted EU regulations and its so-called four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
Switzerland's agreement also requires the free movement of people but has less access for the services industry, a vital part of the UK's economy.
To achieve his goal of ""full access"" but no ""EU regulation"" from Iceland to the Russian border Mr Gove would have to come to a deal with the EU, the EEA and a number of European countries outside the EU, notably Switzerland.
Stephen Booth, co-director of think tank Open Europe, said: ""The term free trade is a misnomer. What we're really talking about is preferential trade. It's about: 'You can have access to our market in return for access to yours'
""If you want preferential access the only way to do that is through a negotiation and a negotiation is a two-way street. You're not going to get something for nothing.""
We can assume a deal for ""full access"" to the EU market will be impossible without concessions on either EU regulation or the free movement of people, or both.
The German and French governments have made it clear being in the single market means free movement of people, for example.
We could have freedom from EU regulation under World Trade Organisation rules but we can expect EU tariffs on our goods - not free access.
It is perfectly reasonable to assume the EU and other European countries would want to do trade deals with the UK but there is no reason to believe the UK can expect special treatment.
Reality Check verdict: Full access with no regulation may be Mr Gove's hope but it looks impossible to deliver in practice.
READ MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate","We got an insight to the sort of trade deal the leave campaign would like to secure for Britain outside the EU this morning when Michael Gove said: ""There is a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Turkey that all European nations have access to â€¦ after we vote to leave we will remain in this zone."""
