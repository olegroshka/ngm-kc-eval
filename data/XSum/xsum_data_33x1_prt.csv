The plan calls for five policy actions:
By Andrew WalkerEconomics correspondent, BBC World Service
The proposals set out by the European Commission chief follow a commitment from the French and German leaders to produce a plan for the crisis by the end of the month.
One key element is strengthening the banks. Under the proposals, many of them would have to raise new capital to improve confidence that they could cope with any losses on problem loans. If they can't raise it privately, it would have to come from governments or the European bailout facility.
There has been a welcome in financial markets for Mr Barroso's plan. But it does have risks. In particular, throwing more public money at the problem, for example at the banks, could put further strain on the finances of some governments, notably France.
And it needs more detail and acceptance by eurozone leaders. They in turn will struggle to sell these ideas to voters who are weary of austerity and bailouts for banks and governments.
Late on Tuesday, Slovakia voted against increasing the powers of the EFSF - the only one of the 17 members of the eurozone to do so.
However, internal political wrangling was behind the no vote, and observers expect a fresh vote before the end of this week.
In addition to expanding the EFSF's powers, the measures agreed in July by eurozone leaders also included private lenders taking a 21% hit on loans to the Greek government.
However, investors now believe both these measures are inadequate. They are calling for the bailout fund to be increased towards 2 trillion euros, and believe private investors will be forced to take a much bigger hit than the 21% suggested.
The leaders also agreed in July to a second bailout package for Greece worth 109bn euros.
The commission, along with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, has been in Athens deciding whether to release the latest tranche of funds from the first bailout agreed in 2010.
On Tuesday, the three bodies agreed measures that Greece needs to take to bring down its debt levels and said they were likely to release the 8bn euros that country needs to pay its bills.
Leaders have been heavily criticised, particularly by investors, for not taking decisive action to end the crisis.
However, there is feeling now that such action will be forthcoming, analysts say, with all eyes on a summit of EU leaders on 23 October and a G20 meeting in Cannes at the beginning of November.",False,"The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, has set out a plan designed to bring an end to the eurozone debt crisis."

There has been a welcome in financial markets for Mr Barroso's plan. But it does have risks. In particular, befuddle more public money at the problem, for example at the banks, could couch further strain on the finances of some governmets, notably France.
And it needs more detail and adoption by eurozone leaders. They in bit will skin to sell these theme to voters who are weary of austerity and bailouts for banks and governments.
ate on Tuesday, Slovakia voted against increasing the powers of the EFSF - the only one of the XVII members of the eurozone to do so.
However, internal political wrangling was behind the no vote, and observers expect a impertinent vote before the end of this week.
In addition to amplify the EFSF's powers, the step agreed in July by eurozone leaders also included private lenders consume a 21% hit on loans to the Greek government.
However, investors now believe both these measures are inadequate. They are calling for the bailout fund to be increased towards deuce trillion euros, and believe private investoWs will be forced to fill a much bigger striking than the 21% suggested.
The leaders also agreed in July to a second bailout package for Greece worth 109bn euros.
The commission, along with the International monetary Fund and the European Centra Bank, has been in Athens deciding whether to release the up-to-the-minute tranche of funds from the first bailout agreed in 2010.
On Tuesday, the three bodies agreed measures that Greece needs to pack to bring down its debt floor and said they were likely to button the 8bn euros that country necessitate to give its billi.
Leaders have been heavily criticcsed, particularly by investors, for not taking decisive action to terminate the crisis.

Researchers took measurements - including blood pressure and heart activity - from anaesthetised rats gripped by the snakes.
This showed that the lethal grip restricted blood flow severely enough to cut off the blood flow supplying oxygen to its vital organs.
The findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.
This ""circulatory arrest"", the scientists say, is a much more efficient, rapid and definite way of finishing off prey than expected.
As the lead researcher, Prof Scott Boback, from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, explained, restricting blood flow to the brain would also make a rodent ""pass out within seconds"".
The researchers believe that recording during a constriction could reveal useful details about how crush injuries cause complex tissue damage in humans.
But Prof Boback and his team are interested primarily in the fundamental question of how and why these snakes evolved their unique killing method.
""The thing I find fascinating is that all snakes have is their mouth to engage with prey,"" said Prof Boback.
""A [constrictor] has to hold a potentially dangerous animal right next to it.
""And that animal's fighting for its life, so it will absolutely take chunks out the snake if it can.""
He and his colleagues realised that, in order to measure this life-or-death battle, they would need to record the very point of death of the prey.
They presented anaesthetised, unconscious lab rats to boa constrictors, and recorded from the rats' arteries and heart as they were squeezed.
The scientists also took blood samples before and after, revealing how the blood chemistry of a constricted victim changed.
From this, they concluded that the constriction ""shuts off"" blood flow and oxygen supply to the organs.
And this lack of oxygen, or ischaemia, rapidly destroys the tissue of the oxygen-hungry brain, heart and liver.
""If the snake is wrapping around the chest, it could also be limiting breathing, too,"" said Dr Boback.
""But an absence of blood flow will cause death more rapidly than suffocation.
""So it could be considered a much more precise and efficient method of killing.""
This study is the first to test for this circulatory arrest directly - measuring from the body of the snake's prey.
Prof Brad Moon, from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, has studied snake movements, including constriction, for two decades.
He said the study showed constrictors could ""squeeze prey hard enough"" to interfere with blood pressures, blood gases, blood chemistry, and even heart function.

32287609,"Mars should be too cold to support liquid water at the surface, but salts in the soil lower its freezing point - allowing briny films to form.
The results lend credence to a theory that dark streaks seen on features such as crater walls could be formed by flowing water.
The results are published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Scientists think thin films of water form when salts in the soil, called perchlorates, absorb water vapour from the atmosphere.
The temperature of these liquid films is about -70C - too cold to support any of the microbial life forms that we know about.
Forming in the top 15cm of the Martian soil, the brines would also be exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation - another challenge to life.
But it's still possible that organisms could exist somewhere beneath the surface on Mars, where conditions are more favourable.
The researchers drew together different lines of evidence collected over a Martian year, and from different instruments carried by the Curiosity rover.
The Rover Environmental Monitoring System (REMS) - essentially the vehicle's weather station - measured the relative humidity and temperature at the rover's landing site of Gale Crater.
Scientists were also able to estimate the subsurface water content using data from an instrument called Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN). These data were consistent with water in the soil being bound to perchlorates.
Finally, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument gave the researchers the content of water vapour in the atmosphere.
The results show conditions were right for the brines to form during winter nights at the Martian equator, where Curiosity landed. But the liquid evaporates during the Martian day when temperatures rise.
Javier Martin-Torres, a co-investigator on the Curiosity mission and lead scientist on REMS, told BBC News the detection was indirect but convincing: ""What we see are the conditions for the formation of brines on the surface. It's similar to when people were discovering the first exoplanets.
""They were not seeing the planets, but they were able to see the gravitational effects on the star.
""These perchlorate salts have a property called deliquescence. They take the water vapour from the atmosphere and absorb it to produce the brines.""
He added: ""We see a daily water cycle - which is very important. This cycle is maintained by the brine. On Earth we have an exchange between the atmosphere and the ground through rain. But we don't have this on Mars.""
While one might think that liquid water would form at warmer temperatures, the formation of brines is the result of an interaction between temperature and atmospheric pressure. It happens that the sweet spot for formation of these liquid films is at colder temperatures.
The fact that the scientists see evidence for these brines at the Martian equator - where conditions are least favourable - means that they might be more persistent at higher latitudes, in areas where the humidity is higher and temperatures are lower.
In these regions they might even be present all year round.
Dark streaks on slopes seen by orbiting spacecraft have long been thought to be the product of running water seeping from the Martian soil. But this interpretation has been contested.

BP's chief financial officer Brian Gilvary said: ""We continue to make good progress in adapting to the challenging price and margin environment.
""We remain on track to rebalance organic cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel, underpinned by continued strong operating reliability and momentum in resetting costs and capital spending.
""At the same time, we are investing in the projects, businesses and options to deliver growth in the years ahead.""
BP also cut its investment plans for this year. It now expects to spend $16bn on capital expenditure, compared with a previous prediction of $17-19bn. For 2017, it is forecasting investment of $15-17bn.
Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said: ""Shell delivered better results this quarter, reflecting strong operational and cost performance.""
He added: ""But lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business and the outlook remains uncertain.""
Earlier this year, Shell completed its purchase of BG Group for $50bn. It is now aiming to cut costs and sell $30bn of assets in order to reduce debts.

The oil price peaked at about $115 a barrel in the summer of 2014, but then fell sharply due to a combination of increased supply and slowing demand.

38091816,"Armed forces have been killing Rohingya in Rakhine state, forcing many to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, says John McKissick of the UN refugee agency.
The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been conducting counter-insurgency operations since coordinated attacks on border guards in October.
It denies reports of atrocities.
A spokesman said the government was ""very, very disappointed"" by the comments.
Burmese officials say Rohingya are setting fire to their own houses in northern Rakhine state. The BBC cannot visit the area to verify what is occurring there, as journalists and aid workers have been barred.
The Rohingya, who number about one million, are seen by many of Myanmar's Buddhist majority as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
Although Bangladesh's official policy is not to allow in illegal entrants across the border, the foreign ministry has confirmed that thousands of Rohingya have already sought refuge in the country, while thousands more are reportedly gathering on the border.
Some are using smugglers to get into Bangladesh, while others have bribed border guards, according to Amnesty International.
Efforts to resolve the issue must focus on ""the root cause"" inside Myanmar, Mr McKissick, head of the UN refugee agency UNHCR in the Bangladeshi border town of Cox's Bazar, told BBC Bengali's Akbar Hossain.
He said the Myanmar military and Border Guard Police had ""engaged in collective punishment of the Rohingya minority"" after the murders of nine border guards on 9 October which some politicians blamed on a Rohingya militant group.
Security forces have been ""killing men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to cross the river"" into Bangladesh, Mr McKissick said.
""Now it's very difficult for the Bangladeshi government to say the border is open because this would further encourage the government of Myanmar to continue the atrocities and push them out until they have achieved their ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority in Myanmar,"" he said.
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is in a delicate position. She is Myanmar's de facto leader, but security is under the control of the autonomous armed forces.
If Ms Suu Kyi bows to international pressure and sets up a credible investigation into the alleged abuses in Rakhine state, she risks fracturing her relationship with the army. It could jeopardise the stability of her young government.
So for the last six weeks Ms Suu Kyi has kept her head firmly in the sand, avoiding journalists and press conferences.
When forced, she has commented that the military in Rakhine is operating according to the ""rule of law"". Few believe that to be the case.
While there are loud calls from overseas for action, most Burmese have very little sympathy for the Rohingya. The army's ""clearance operations"" against the ""violent attackers"" of Rakhine state appear to have strong popular support, putting Ms Suu Kyi under very little domestic pressure.
Myanmar's presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said Mr McKissick ""should maintain his professionalism and his ethics as a United Nations officer because his comments are just allegations"".
""He should only speak based on concrete and strong evidence on the ground,"" he said.
On Wednesday, the Bangladesh foreign ministry summoned Myanmar's ambassador to express ""deep concern"" over the military operation in northern Rakhine state.
It said ""desperate people"" were crossing the border seeking safety and shelter and asked Myanmar to ""ensure the integrity of its border"".
Authorities in Bangladesh have been detaining and repatriating hundreds of fleeing Rohingya, which Amnesty International condemned as a violation of international law.
Bangladesh does not recognise Rohingya as refugees, and many of those fleeing Myanmar have been ""forced into hiding and are suffering a severe lack of food and medical care"", the rights group said.
Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers have arrived into Bangladesh from Myanmar in waves since at least the 1970s. There are some 33,000 registered Rohingya refugees living in Cox's Bazar's two camps, Kutupalong and Nayapara.
Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch released satellite images which it said showed that more than 1,200 homes had been razed in Rohingya villages over the past six weeks.
A massive security operation was launched last month after nine police officers were killed in co-ordinated attacks on border posts in Maungdaw.
Some government officials blamed a militant Rohingya group for the attacks. Security forces then sealed off access to Maungdaw district and launched a counter-insurgency operation.
Rohingya activists say more than 100 people have been killed and hundreds arrested amid the crackdown.
Soldiers have also been accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, rape and executions, which the government has flatly denied.
It says militants have attacked helicopter gunships providing air support to troops.
The estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are seen by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship by the government despite many having lived there for generations.
Communal violence in Rakhine state in 2012 left scores dead and displaced more than 100,000 people, with many Rohingya still remaining in decrepit camps.
They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment.
Hundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having left Myanmar over decades.
Myanmar held its first openly contested election in 25 years last November, with Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning a landslide victory.
Though she is barred from the presidency due to a constitutional rule, Ms Suu Kyi, who serves as State Counsellor, is seen as de-facto leader.
But her government, led as it is by a former human rights icon, has faced international criticism over the dire situation in Rakhine state.
Rights groups have questioned why journalists and aid workers are not being allowed to enter northern Rakhine.
Presidential spokesman Zaw Htay says the international media is misreporting what is going on.",False,"Myanmar is seeking the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Rohingya minority from its territory, a senior UN official has told the BBC."
38091816_1,"armed forces have been killing Rohingya in Rakhine nation, forcing many to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, says John McKissick of the UN refugee agency.
The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been conducting counter-insurgency operations xince coordinated attacks on molding guards in October.
It denies study of heinousness.
A spokesman aver the government was ""very, very disappointed"" by the commens.
Burmese officials say Rohingya are limit fire to their own houses in northern Rakhine state. The BBC cannot confabulate the area to verify what is occurring there, as journalists and aid workers have been barred.
The Rohingya, who number about one million, are seen by many of Myanmar's Buddhist majority as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
Although Bangladesh's official policy is not to allow in illegal etrants across the border, the foreign ministry has confirmed that thousands of Rohingya have already sought refuQe in the country, while thousands more are reportedly pucker on the adjoin.
Some are using smugglers to amaze into Bangladesh, while others have bribed border guards, according to Amnesty International.
Efforts to resolve the issue must focus on ""the root cause"" inside Myanmar, r McKissick, head of the UN refugee agency UNHR in the Bangladeshi border town of Cox's Bazar, told BBC Bengali's Akbar Hossain.
He said the Myanmar military and march Guard police had ""occupied in collective punishment of the Rohingya minority"" after the murders of nine edge guards on 9 October which some holiticians blamed on a Rohingya militant group.
Security forces have been ""killing men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to bad-tempered the river"" into Bangladesh, Mr McKissick said.
""Now it's very difficult for the Bangladeshi government to say the border is open because this would further encourage the government of Mxanmar to continue the atrocities and labor them out until they have achieved their ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority in Myanmar,"" he said.
Nobel laureate Aung an Suu Kyi is in a delicate posture. She is Myanmar's de facto leader, but security is under the ascendency of the autonomous armed storm.
Ii Ms Suu Kyi bows to international squeeze and sets up a credible investigation into the alleged maltreatment in Rakhine land, she risks fracturing her relationship with the army. It could jeopardise the stability of her youthful goPernment.
So for the last sise weeks Ms Suu Kyi has kept her promontory firmly in the sand, avoiding journalists and crush conferences.
When ram, she has commented that the military in Rakhine is operating according to the ""prevail of law"". Few believe that to be the case.
While there are loud calls from overseas for action, most Burmese have very lilliputian sympathy for the Rohingya. The army's ""clearance operations"" against the ""violent attackers"" of Rakhine state appear to have hard popular stand, putt Ms Suu KyC under very little domestic pressure.
Myanmar's presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said Mr McKissick ""should exert his professionalism and his ethics as a United Nations officer because his comments are just allegations"".
""He should only speak based on concrete and Utrong evidence on the ground,"" he said.
On Wed, the Bangladesh foreign ministry sumoned Myanmar's ambassador to express ""deep headache"" over the military operation in Northern Rakhine state.
It said ""desperate people"" were crossing the border seeking safty and shelter and asked Myanmar to ""ensure the integrity of its march"".
Authorities in Bangladesh have been detaining and repatriating hundreds of fleeing Rohingya, which Amnesty International doom as a violation of international law.
Bangladesh does not recognise Rogingya as refugees, and many of those fleeing Myanmar have been ""storm into hidng and are suffering a severe lack of food and medical care"", the rights group said.
Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers have arrived into Bangladesh from Myanmar in flap since at least the 1970s. There are some 33,000 registered Rohingya refugees living in Cox's Bazar's two amps, Kutupalong and Nayapara.
other this week, Human Rights check discharge planet imagts which it enounce register that more than 1,200 homes had been razed in Rohingya Village over the past six weeks.
A massive security operation was launch last month after nine police officer were down in co-ordinated attacks on border posts in Maungaw.
Some government officials blamed a militant Rohingya group for the assail. Security squeeze then plastered off access to Maungdaw district and launched a counter-insurgency operation.
Rohingya activists say more than 100 people have been killed and hundreds arrested amid the crackdown.
Soldiers have also been accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, rape and executions, which the government has flatly denied.
It says militants have attacked helicopter gunships providing air suport to troops.
The estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are discover by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are refuse citizenship by the government disdain many having lived there for genesis.
Communal violence in Rakhine sate in 2012 bequeath grade dead and displaced more than C,000 people, with many Rohingya stock-still continue in decrepit camps.
They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment.

39388860,"Sone Aluko poked home the only goal of the game to lift the Cottagers into the play-off places.
The scrambled finish ended Rotherham's three-season stay in the second-tier.
Fulham keeper David Button had earlier denied Lee Frecklington and Jon Taylor, while Danny Ward also went close.
Ward wasted the best chance of the first half, sending a free header wide, while Taylor was foiled moments after Chris Martin wasted Fulham's first real chance.
The goal which inflicted an eighth straight defeat on Rotherham, and sent them down, was an untidy one, with defender Darnell Fisher and goalkeeper Lewis Price initially blocking efforts before Aluko finished from close range.
Fulham's first win in three games was enough to move them above Sheffield Wednesday after the Owls were held to a 1-1 draw against Barnsley earlier in the day.
Since a 2-1 defeat by Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield on 27 September, Rotherham have been bottom of the Championship.
In total, the Millers have spent just 26 days of the 239 this season outside the relegation places.
Caretaker boss Paul Warne was the man to oversee relegation, having taken charge of the club in November after Kenny Jackett -  who succeeded Alan Stubbs - resigned after just 39 days at the helm.
Rotherham interim boss Paul Warne: ""There's a little bit of embarrassment. I took the reins a few months ago and I haven't been good enough to get the results to keep us up and that is on my head.
""The performances have been okay at times but we haven't got that strength in depth. But that's my fault, it's not anyone else's.
""I don't think anyone thought before today that we would stay up, we weren't going to win eight on the spin. So to have relegated next to our name isn't too much of a shock.""
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: ""It is a great step for us towards where we want to be.
""It was a very tough game. I am pleased because I have missed some 1-0 wins, so to get the goal and then finish with a clean sheet is pleasing and it is important news for us.
""We tried to be focused on our job and thinking about what we can do.
""We weren't thinking about Sheffield Wednesday or about other teams. Our focus is on us in this crucial part of the competition and getting as many points as is possible for us.""
