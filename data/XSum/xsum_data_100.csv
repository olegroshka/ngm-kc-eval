11890278,"President Francois Bozize published the decree as part of the country's 50th anniversary of independence, returning Bokassa ""all his rights"".
Bokassa was overthrown in 1979 after 14 years in power and died in 1996.
He was variously accused of being a cannibal and feeding opponents to lions and crocodiles in his personal zoo.
President Bozize, who himself seized power in a coup in 2003, said his former boss had ""given a great deal for humanity"".
Bokassa was ""a son of the nation recognised by all as a great builder"", Mr Bozize said.
""He built the country but we have destroyed what he built,"" the president added as he awarded Bokassa's widow, Catherine, a state medal of honour.
""This rehabilitation of rights erases penal condemnations, particularly fines and legal costs, and stops any future incapacities that result from them,"" the decree said.
Bokassa came to power in a coup in 1965 and ruled ruthlessly, torturing and killing political rivals.
He named himself emperor in 1976 but was overthrown in 1979 when his guards killed scores of schoolchildren during a period of unrest in the capital, Bangui.
The children were protesting against Bokassa's proclamation that they would have to wear expensive uniforms only sold by a company that belonged to one of his 17 wives.
Crowds vented their hatred on a giant statue of him.
For most of his rule Bokassa was backed by former colonial power France.
Sentenced to death for murder and embezzlement, Bokassa spent five years in prison before dying of a heart attack in the capital Bangui in 1996.
Despite the excesses of his rule there had been a movement to rehabilitate him, with a number of politicians pointing to periods of stability and patriotism.","The former president of the Central African Republic, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, has been formally rehabilitated by presidential decree."

The aim is to tackle what police called ""a substantial rise in verbal radicalism"".

Holger Munch, president of Germany's federal criminal police authority, the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) said: ""Today's action makes it clear that police authorities of the federal and state governments act firmly against hate and incitement on the internet.""
He said politically motivated hate crime on the internet had increased significantly in the wake of the European refugee crisis.
Last year, Germany took in up to one million migrants and refugees.
""Attacks on refugee shelters are often the result of radicalisation which begins in social networks,"" Mr Munch said.

Incitement of racial hatred is a crime under German law and a person can be jailed for up to five years in a case of inciting ""hatred against a national, racial, religious group or a group defined by their ethnic origins"".

Colin started running marathons for breast cancer research and has asked MSPs to commit to holding trials to find breakthroughs in treatment.
The campaign has called for the Scottish government and MSPs to support the following aims:
It has been estimated that a woman is five times more likely to survive breast cancer if it is caught at its earliest stage.
Four in 10 breast cancers in the UK could be prevented by adopting healthier lifestyles.
Women taking part in a study funded by the Chief Scientist Office, were offered a one hour face-to-face consultation with a lifestyle coach when they attended their mammogram appointment.
The support also included follow-up calls for 12 weeks to help them in their chosen lifestyle goals. Some women were given pedometers to help monitor their progress.
The study found that it helped with weight loss, improved physical activity and reduced waist size.

Security forces are still able to make arrests without warrants and detain people without charge, while Gen Prayuth - who led last year's coup - can rule by executive order in the name of national security.
The media remains heavily restricted and political gatherings of more than five people are still banned.

Mr Osinbajo, now back in Nigeria, said he had discussed a wide range of issues during the hour-long meeting.
Mr Buhari has been in London since May.
Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories
The 74-year-old leader was elected to power in 2015, becoming the first Nigerian  opposition leader to win an election.
It is his second period of medical leave in the UK, the first began in January and he returned home in March.
His long absence has led to speculation about whether he will be able to resume his presidential duties.
In his absence, President Buhari has given Vice-President Osinbajo full powers to act, in contrast to the situation in 2009, when the long illness of then President Umaru Yar'Adua led to a power vacuum.
By Ibrahim Shehu, BBC Hausa, Abuja
Nigerians are becoming increasingly sceptical about President Buhari's fitness to continue to govern the country effectively.
His indefinite medical leave and the economy in recession means the hope and aspirations of the electorate who brought him to power more than two years ago have died.
The uncertainty surrounding Mr Buhari's ability to continue to govern, or stand in elections in 2019, has left a lot of his political associates and supporters in limbo, as campaigning for 2019 begins in earnest a year from now.
Earlier this week, Nigeria's first lady Aisha Buhari launched a cryptic attack, apparently aimed at powerful ruling party politicians suspected of manoeuvring for the presidency or deputy presidency while her husband was ill.
In a Facebook post, Mrs Buhari warned that ""hyenas and jackals"" would be banished.
The vice-president has been acting in Mr Buhari's place while he is out of the country, but there is no suggestion he is part of any plot against the leader, says the BBC's Naziru Mikailu.
Mrs Buhari's comments came in response to a post from Senator Shehu Sani, who warned that people were ""scheming... so that they can be kings"".
""Prayers for the absent Lion King has waned,"" he wrote. ""Now the hyenas and the jackals are scheming and talking to each other in whispers; still doubting whether the Lion King will be back or not.""
But Mrs Buhari appeared to calm any concerns - suggesting her husband, positioned as the defender of the ""weaker animals"", was on the mend.
""God has answered the prayers of the weaker animals, the hyenas and jackals will soon be sent out the kingdom.""","President Muhammadu Buhari is ""recuperating fast"" and will return home ""very soon"", says Nigeria's acting head of state Yemi Osinbajo."

The plan calls for five policy actions:
By Andrew WalkerEconomics correspondent, BBC World Service
The proposals set out by the European Commission chief follow a commitment from the French and German leaders to produce a plan for the crisis by the end of the month.
One key element is strengthening the banks. Under the proposals, many of them would have to raise new capital to improve confidence that they could cope with any losses on problem loans. If they can't raise it privately, it would have to come from governments or the European bailout facility.
There has been a welcome in financial markets for Mr Barroso's plan. But it does have risks. In particular, throwing more public money at the problem, for example at the banks, could put further strain on the finances of some governments, notably France.
And it needs more detail and acceptance by eurozone leaders. They in turn will struggle to sell these ideas to voters who are weary of austerity and bailouts for banks and governments.
Late on Tuesday, Slovakia voted against increasing the powers of the EFSF - the only one of the 17 members of the eurozone to do so.
However, internal political wrangling was behind the no vote, and observers expect a fresh vote before the end of this week.
In addition to expanding the EFSF's powers, the measures agreed in July by eurozone leaders also included private lenders taking a 21% hit on loans to the Greek government.
However, investors now believe both these measures are inadequate. They are calling for the bailout fund to be increased towards 2 trillion euros, and believe private investors will be forced to take a much bigger hit than the 21% suggested.
The leaders also agreed in July to a second bailout package for Greece worth 109bn euros.
The commission, along with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, has been in Athens deciding whether to release the latest tranche of funds from the first bailout agreed in 2010.
On Tuesday, the three bodies agreed measures that Greece needs to take to bring down its debt levels and said they were likely to release the 8bn euros that country needs to pay its bills.
Leaders have been heavily criticised, particularly by investors, for not taking decisive action to end the crisis.
However, there is feeling now that such action will be forthcoming, analysts say, with all eyes on a summit of EU leaders on 23 October and a G20 meeting in Cannes at the beginning of November.","The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, has set out a plan designed to bring an end to the eurozone debt crisis."
39692130,"Judges are now required to give special information to jurors in some trials, including that many victims of rape or sexual assault ""freeze"" rather than fight back.
The move is designed to challenge any pre-conceived notions jurors may have about how a person should react when they are a victim of a sexual offence.
Rape Crisis Scotland welcomed the move.
Sandy Brindley, co-ordinator for the organisation, said: ""Survivors often tell us that during a rape they froze and were unable to fight back or scream.
""This is a completely natural and common reaction, but not always one that members of the public will necessarily be aware of.
""We welcome the introduction of jury directions in rape cases as a significant step forward.
""Providing jury members with factual information on different reactions to rape should help to ensure that verdicts in sexual offence cases are based on the evidence presented rather than being influenced by assumptions about how rape victims should react.""
Under the new laws, judges will give special information to juries in certain sexual offence trials, including where there is a delay in the victim reporting the crime, where there is no evidence of physical resistance by the victim and where the perpetrator has not used physical force.
The Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm (Scotland) Act 2016 also sees the introduction of a new statutory aggravation which means courts will be required to take into account whether or not an offence involved abuse of a partner or ex-partner.
The act further introduces an extension of the law concerning certain sexual offences committed against children, to allow for prosecution in Scottish courts of offences committed elsewhere in the UK.
The change is aimed at reducing the potential trauma for victims who might otherwise face more than one trial.
Powers to protect victims from further harassment are also being extended by allowing a criminal non-harassment order to be imposed in a wider range of circumstances.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""Abusive behaviour and sexual harm will not be tolerated in Scotland.
""Tackling these crimes requires a bold response and speedy and effective enforcement, which is why we have introduced new laws to improve the way our justice system responds.
""By continuing to modernise the law we can support victims in accessing justice and ensure perpetrators are properly held to account for their actions.""",New laws have come into force aimed at improving the way sexual offences are dealt with in courts in Scotland.
36248193,"It comes after an outcry over the death of a student who tried an experimental cancer therapy that came top of the list in his Baidu web search.
Baidu had come under fire for allegedly selling listings to bidders without adequately checking their claims.
The search engine giant says it will now overhaul its search results so they are primarily ranked by credibility.
Baidu is China's largest search engine with 70% market share and more than 660 million people using its mobile search every month.
Currently, on Baidu, listings that have paid for a prominent placement are marked at the bottom with a small sign saying ""promote"", but many say this does not identify them as paid-for listings sufficiently clearly.
In a statement (in Chinese) on Monday, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Baidu's search results appeared to have ""had an impact"" on student Wei Zexi's choice of treatment.
Baidu gave ""too much weight"" to paid-for advertisements in its search results, ""commercial promotions were not clearly marked"", and this had ""affected the impartiality and objectivity"" of Baidu's search results, the statement added.
The regulator demanded that Baidu make several changes, including:
In response, Baidu said it would ""implement all the changes demanded by investigators, and deeply reflect on its shortcomings"".
It would ""thoroughly investigate its medical promotions, and change its search results ranking system so they are primarily ranked by credibility"", and ""control the number of commercial promotions per page"".
Analysts said that Baidu's shares fell by 5% in pre-market trading in New York on Monday, as healthcare provides 20-30% of its search revenue, Reuters reported.
Student Wei Zexi, who was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma in 2014, had said he found out about a controversial cancer treatment through Baidu.
The treatment was unsuccessful and the 21-year-old student died on 12 April.
Before his death, Wei publicly accused the hospital of misleading him and his family of the treatment's effectiveness, and criticised Baidu for selling search listings for medical information to the highest bidder.
Baidu has denied ranking hospitals in promoted search results solely based on how much they paid, and says the hospital had been approved by the Beijing municipal government.","Baidu must reduce the number of paid-for adverts it includes in its search results, Chinese regulators say."

Earlier on Wednesday Keane was named in the Republic's squad for the Oman game and the opening World Cup qualifier against Serbia on 5 September.
However, the ex-Spurs striker later released a statement confirming his impending international retirement.
Keane, 36, has scored a record 67 goals for the Republic in 145 appearances.
The LA Galaxy striker was a late substitute in the Republic's Euro 2016 games against Sweden and Belgium but is no longer a regular starter for Martin O'Neill's side.
""It has been a wonderful journey for me to have played with the Irish national team for over 18 years since I made my senior international debut back in 1998,"" said Keane.
""I have enjoyed it all. It has also been a great honour, for both me and my family, to have been given the opportunity to captain my country for over 10 years.
""As a young boy growing up in Dublin playing football on the street I could never have imagined the path my life would take. It has exceeded my wildest expectations.""
The Dubliner made his senior international debut against the Czech Republic in March 1998 four months before helping his country win the European Under-18 Championship in Cyprus.
""I would never have believed all those years ago that I would get the opportunity to play for my country 145 times and to score 67 goals,"" added Keane in his statement.
""I have been on the most incredible journey with the Irish team and fans over the last 18 years and words cannot express how proud I am to be Irish.
""I look back at the 17-year-old kid making his international debut, taken under the wing of Mick McCarthy and the FAI, and think of the person I am today and realise how playing for Ireland has been such a huge influence in my life.""
During McCarthy's reign, Keane scored a memorable Republic equaliser against Germany in the 2002 World Cup finals, which the LA Galaxy striker recalled fondly on Wednesday.
""One (memory) in particular stands out - the 2002 World Cup and scoring the late goal in Ibaraki, Japan against Oliver Kahn.
""The atmosphere, the adrenaline and the buzz from the fans that night is something I will always remember.""
Keane became only the fourth Republic player to reach 100 caps when he started against Argentina in 2010.
Commenting on Keane's announcement, Republic manager Martin O'Neill described the striker as ""undoubtedly one of Ireland's finest ever players"".
""I do not see his international goal record being beaten for a very long time, if ever,"" added O'Neill.
""It will take us some time to get over his absence.""
Another Keane goal against Oman next week will move him level with German great Gerd Muller, currently the fourth best European marksman in international football history behind Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Miroslav Klose.",Robbie Keane has announced that the Republic of Ireland's friendly against Oman in Dublin on 31 August will be his last international.
26746169,"The craft was expected to dock with the station six hours after its launch from Kazakhstan early on Wednesday morning.
However, a 24-second engine thruster burn required to change its orbit path failed to work as planned.
The crew are not said to be in any danger. The joint mission comes amid high tension between the US and Russia.
The two governments have been exchanging terse rhetoric after Russia's annexation of Crimea this month.
However, co-operation on the space programme has continued, a legacy of the thaw in relations that accompanied the end of the Cold War.
At a press conference before the flight, the astronauts said they would treat dinners aboard the space station ""as an opportunity to come together as friends in the kitchen and look each other in the eye"".
The Soyuz booster rocket, carrying Russians Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev and American Steve Swanson, blasted off from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
However, shortly before the craft was due to dock with the space station, officials reported that an engine that was meant to guide the manoeuvre had not operated ""as planned"".
Oleg Ostapenko, the head of the Roscosmos Russian space agency, said that the problem had been caused by a failure of the ship's orientation system.
""The crew have taken off their spacesuits and are continuing their flight normally,"" he said.
The astronauts are now aiming to dock with the space station at the next best opportunity - likely to be 23:58 GMT on Thursday.
The crew have reverted to a two-day approach, used by Russian flights to the space station until 2012. This involves orbiting Earth 34 times.
The shorter, six-hour approach - orbiting Earth only four times - was introduced last year.
The US relies on Russia to fly its astronauts to the space station since it retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011.
The space station - an orbiting laboratory high above Earth - is operated by 15 nations. It currently has a crew of three.

33625080,"The work has busted a myth that the snakes suffocate their victims.
Researchers took measurements - including blood pressure and heart activity - from anaesthetised rats gripped by the snakes.
This showed that the lethal grip restricted blood flow severely enough to cut off the blood flow supplying oxygen to its vital organs.
The findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.
This ""circulatory arrest"", the scientists say, is a much more efficient, rapid and definite way of finishing off prey than expected.
As the lead researcher, Prof Scott Boback, from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, explained, restricting blood flow to the brain would also make a rodent ""pass out within seconds"".
The researchers believe that recording during a constriction could reveal useful details about how crush injuries cause complex tissue damage in humans.
But Prof Boback and his team are interested primarily in the fundamental question of how and why these snakes evolved their unique killing method.
""The thing I find fascinating is that all snakes have is their mouth to engage with prey,"" said Prof Boback.
""A [constrictor] has to hold a potentially dangerous animal right next to it.
""And that animal's fighting for its life, so it will absolutely take chunks out the snake if it can.""
He and his colleagues realised that, in order to measure this life-or-death battle, they would need to record the very point of death of the prey.
They presented anaesthetised, unconscious lab rats to boa constrictors, and recorded from the rats' arteries and heart as they were squeezed.
The scientists also took blood samples before and after, revealing how the blood chemistry of a constricted victim changed.
From this, they concluded that the constriction ""shuts off"" blood flow and oxygen supply to the organs.
And this lack of oxygen, or ischaemia, rapidly destroys the tissue of the oxygen-hungry brain, heart and liver.
""If the snake is wrapping around the chest, it could also be limiting breathing, too,"" said Dr Boback.
""But an absence of blood flow will cause death more rapidly than suffocation.
""So it could be considered a much more precise and efficient method of killing.""
This study is the first to test for this circulatory arrest directly - measuring from the body of the snake's prey.
Prof Brad Moon, from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, has studied snake movements, including constriction, for two decades.
He said the study showed constrictors could ""squeeze prey hard enough"" to interfere with blood pressures, blood gases, blood chemistry, and even heart function.
""It isn't the first test of circulatory arrest from constriction,"" Prof Moon told BBC News, ""but it is the first direct test that measured blood pressures and [heart activity].
""It shows that constriction is stronger, faster and more effective than expected.""
In a previous study, the same Dickinson College team discovered that the snakes were able to sense their victim's heartbeat, and stopped squeezing only when it stopped.

32287609,"Mars should be too cold to support liquid water at the surface, but salts in the soil lower its freezing point - allowing briny films to form.
The results lend credence to a theory that dark streaks seen on features such as crater walls could be formed by flowing water.
The results are published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Scientists think thin films of water form when salts in the soil, called perchlorates, absorb water vapour from the atmosphere.
The temperature of these liquid films is about -70C - too cold to support any of the microbial life forms that we know about.
Forming in the top 15cm of the Martian soil, the brines would also be exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation - another challenge to life.
But it's still possible that organisms could exist somewhere beneath the surface on Mars, where conditions are more favourable.
The researchers drew together different lines of evidence collected over a Martian year, and from different instruments carried by the Curiosity rover.
The Rover Environmental Monitoring System (REMS) - essentially the vehicle's weather station - measured the relative humidity and temperature at the rover's landing site of Gale Crater.
Scientists were also able to estimate the subsurface water content using data from an instrument called Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN). These data were consistent with water in the soil being bound to perchlorates.
Finally, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument gave the researchers the content of water vapour in the atmosphere.
The results show conditions were right for the brines to form during winter nights at the Martian equator, where Curiosity landed. But the liquid evaporates during the Martian day when temperatures rise.
Javier Martin-Torres, a co-investigator on the Curiosity mission and lead scientist on REMS, told BBC News the detection was indirect but convincing: ""What we see are the conditions for the formation of brines on the surface. It's similar to when people were discovering the first exoplanets.
""They were not seeing the planets, but they were able to see the gravitational effects on the star.
""These perchlorate salts have a property called deliquescence. They take the water vapour from the atmosphere and absorb it to produce the brines.""
He added: ""We see a daily water cycle - which is very important. This cycle is maintained by the brine. On Earth we have an exchange between the atmosphere and the ground through rain. But we don't have this on Mars.""
While one might think that liquid water would form at warmer temperatures, the formation of brines is the result of an interaction between temperature and atmospheric pressure. It happens that the sweet spot for formation of these liquid films is at colder temperatures.
The fact that the scientists see evidence for these brines at the Martian equator - where conditions are least favourable - means that they might be more persistent at higher latitudes, in areas where the humidity is higher and temperatures are lower.
In these regions they might even be present all year round.
Dark streaks on slopes seen by orbiting spacecraft have long been thought to be the product of running water seeping from the Martian soil. But this interpretation has been contested.
""It's speculation at this point... but these observations at least support or go in this direction,"" said Dr Martin-Torres.

37832575,"The company made $933m (ÃÂ£763m) on an underlying replacement cost basis, compared with $1.8bn a year earlier.
BP blamed falling oil prices for its fall, saying it was affected by a ""weaker price and margin environment"".
Rival oil company Royal Dutch Shell also warned over oil prices, although its profits rose by 18% from last year.
The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits of $2.8bn (ÃÂ£2.2bn),.
BP's chief financial officer Brian Gilvary said: ""We continue to make good progress in adapting to the challenging price and margin environment.
""We remain on track to rebalance organic cash flows next year at $50 to $55 a barrel, underpinned by continued strong operating reliability and momentum in resetting costs and capital spending.
""At the same time, we are investing in the projects, businesses and options to deliver growth in the years ahead.""
BP also cut its investment plans for this year. It now expects to spend $16bn on capital expenditure, compared with a previous prediction of $17-19bn. For 2017, it is forecasting investment of $15-17bn.
Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said: ""Shell delivered better results this quarter, reflecting strong operational and cost performance.""
He added: ""But lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business and the outlook remains uncertain.""
Earlier this year, Shell completed its purchase of BG Group for $50bn. It is now aiming to cut costs and sell $30bn of assets in order to reduce debts.
Last week, Shell said it had sold Canadian oil and gas assets for $1bn as part of its asset-sale programme.
""Our investment plans and portfolio actions are focused firmly on reshaping Shell into a world-class investment case at all points in the oil-price cycle,"" said Mr van Beurden.
""We are making good progress towards this aim in spite of current challenging market conditions.""
Shares in Shell rose by nearly 4% in London as investors welcomed the results.
Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Despite the respite provided by an improved oil price, conditions remain tough in the oil and gas sector.
""Nonetheless, the return to profit in the upstream division is symbolically important as the group heaves itself out of the well it found itself in after the oil price collapsed.
""Unless the oil price stages a miraculous recovery, there's a long way to go before Shell returns to rude health; nonetheless the group is making progress in climbing the oil pole.""
David Hunter, an energy analyst at Schneider Electric, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believed the two companies were banking on a recovery in oil prices to boost their future profits.
""They're a big contributor in FTSE 100 dividend payouts and have continued to maintain those levels despite the fall in oil prices,"" he said.
""The long-term bet is in the oil price recovering to maintain their ability to pay these dividends.
""There has been generally some momentum building in the oil price relatively recently. Obviously in January it bottomed out at $27 and it's now flirting with the $50 mark - a little bit above and below in recent weeks - so that's a recovery of sorts.""
The oil price peaked at about $115 a barrel in the summer of 2014, but then fell sharply due to a combination of increased supply and slowing demand.
Last month, news that the Opec oil producers' cartel had agreed a limit on production sent the oil price to its highest in a year. However, doubts over whether the group will be able to deliver production cuts have seen crude prices slip recently.",Oil giant BP has reported a near 50% fall in third-quarter profits from last year as the sector continues to struggle with low prices.
40667569,"Orica-Scott's Van Vleuten, 34, attacked the lead group in the final 5km to take victory on the Col d'Izoard summit.
Boels-Doemans rider Deignan, 28, was 43 seconds behind, with Italy's Elisa Longo Borghini a further 40 seconds back in third.
The race ends on Saturday with a 22.5km 'chase' in Marseille.
The top riders will set off according to the time gaps established on the opening stage, with Van Vleuten first on to the course.
Van Vleuten returned to action last year following a horrific crash while leading the road race at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Deignan, the British road race champion and former world champion, started the 67km stage in support of American team-mate Megan Guarnier and did the majority of the riding on the front of the peloton.
She helped bring back lone attacker Linda Villumsen of New Zealand with 9km to go, before an elite group of 10 riders established themselves in the final 6km of the Alpine climb, which averages 7.3% in gradient.
However, Deignan broke free with Australia's Shara Gillow before trying in vain to chase down Van Vleuten, while Guarnier recovered to finish fourth.
""I messed up by being a domestique then a leader, so it's my own fault for not having confidence in myself,"" Deignan told ITV4.
""Megan put her hand up at the start of the day and said she could be leader.
""I wouldn't call myself a time triallist but perhaps this gives me a chance [for overall victory].""
Guarnier finished 45 seconds behind Deignan, who could choose to wait for her team-mate on Saturday's stage so they can work together to chase down Van Vleuten.
Van Vleuten suffered severe concussion and three small fractures in her back when she crashed heavily in the Olympic road race last year.
She has been in impressive form this season, winning two stages of the Giro Rosa stage race and leading the women's World Tour standings.
""To finish here in front of so many people is amazing,"" she said.
""I didn't used to be a climber but after the Olympic Games I proved that I can do it, so have worked more on my climbing.""

39331434,"Pte James Farrell, 18, said he was only trying to warn Rifleman Curtis Horbury during the incident at Catterick Garrison, in North Yorkshire.
But a court martial last month in Colchester heard the blow was aimed at his colleague's head.
Farrell, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, was convicted of attempted murder.
The court heard claims that Mr Horbury was the ""ringleader"" of a gang of trainees who were bullying Farrell, which had culminated in the attack on 13 November.
Farrell said he had no intention of hitting him with the knife and just wanted to scare him to make him leave him alone.
He said on the night in question he was verbally bullied and went out to a smoking area to calm down, but ""lost it"" when he came back and saw Mr Horbury ""smirking"" at him.
The court heard ""it was only by chance"" Mr Horbury was not killed. He managed to dodge the blow by rolling out of the way.
Sentencing Farrell at Colchester Garrison, Vice-Judge Advocate General Michael Hunter told him: ""You reacted in the way you did because you were being verbally bullied and because you couldn't take it.""
Describing it as an ""unusual"" case in which nobody was injured, he said: ""Following that blow, instead of retrieving the knife and continuing your actions you took no further action.
""You did nothing. This, we find, is because although you had clearly intended to kill, you at that point realised the enormity of what you had just intended to do.""
The bullying allegations are now the subject of an ongoing independent investigation by the Royal Military Police.
Farrell, who was with the 2nd Infantry Training Battalion, also admitted possessing 42 rounds of live ammunition and 30 rounds of blank ammunition.

35601787,"Sir Bernard recently said an official policy to automatically believe victims had caused confusion among detectives investigating historical allegations.
He said there was a danger this meant complainants would always be believed.
But in a letter, the chief inspector of constabulary Sir Tom Winsor called Sir Bernard's comments misleading.
He said the policy was used for the purpose of recording a crime, rather than how claims should be investigated.
In 2014, Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) issued guidance which said ""the presumption that a victim should always be believed should be institutionalised"".
Speaking at a BBC event, Sir Bernard said it was time to ""reformulate"" the policy, so police showed empathy towards alleged victims but kept an open mind as they tested claims.
He went on to tell BBC Radio 4's Today programme that police had become ""hung up"" on the word ""belief"" and it had ""confused officers"".
He added there was a ""grave danger"" that ""we will always believe any complaint that is made and that's not wise for any good investigator, nor as it would be for any journalist"".
However, in a letter sent to the Met chief on 11 February, Sir Tom said the guidance was ""conspicuously explicit"" that the presumption of believing complainants was for the purpose of recording a crime once it had been reported to police.
It did not suggest complainants should be believed throughout the investigative process, he added.
He said: ""In saying what you said on the Today programme, without qualification or context, and accepting the misapprehension on the part of the interviewer that the institutionalisation of belief should go much further than the simple administrative act of recording a crime, I regret you may have increased the risk that officers and others may not understand the position.
""Rather than dispel uncertainty, I fear you may have intensified it.""
The Met's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Mark Simmons, said it was ""far from the truth"" to suggest Sir Bernard was ""confused"" or had a ""misapprehension on that issue"".
He added: ""I think the issue more significantly is in these really difficult areas where you go into the heart of some of the issues of vulnerability for some of the people who suffer these offences.
""They're complex matters to investigate and we need to make sure we get to the truth, but no, I'm pretty clear and I think all our people are, the commissioner is not confused about the approach we should be taking.""
A review into the Met's policing procedures, which will be led by an ex-judge, is due to scrutinise the force's handling of investigations including Operation Midland - which is looking at claims that boys were abused by powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies in the 1970s and 80s.
The review follows criticism of the handling of cases involving former military chief Lord Bramall and the late Lord Brittan, a former home secretary.
Lord Bramall, who was told last month no action would be taken against him, later called for a review into the way cases were investigated.

But with just two minutes to play, Saints substitute Liam Craig scored from the spot after being challenged inside the box by Ryan Jack.
Aberdeen players and fans were left furious by the penalty decision.
The home side started this game buoyed by Celtic's slip up in their match against Hamilton on Friday but also shell-shocked by the news they could be without their top scorer Adam Rooney for six weeks.
Derek McInnes' side immediately set out to dominate possession and although they dictated play early on, they missed the obvious target that Rooney so often provides.
As they pushed for the opening goal, Kenny McLean found some space 10 yards out but his shot was weak and Saints goalkeeper Alan Mannus wasn't troubled.
As the first half progressed and the home side failed to take advantage of their possession, St Johnstone began to push forward and find gaps in an Aberdeen defence that, at times, looked very fragile.
Steven MacLean had a couple of decent efforts but his lob from 10 yards out didn't have enough to beat Scott Brown and his volley from the same distance was blocked at the last minute.
But just as it looked like the Dons were living dangerously, Church blasted them into the lead.
Ash Taylor's header from a Niall McGinn corner looked to be goal-bound. Mannus saved well but could not hold it and Church swept the ball into the back of the net from four yards.
It was a goal that not only settled the Aberdeen legions inside Pittodrie, but also the home players, who started to knock the ball around with the confidence of a side who see themselves as title contenders.
But despite their continued domination in the second half, they failed to extend their lead and it was to prove costly.
Jack, McGinn and Pawlett all linked up well but they just could not find a way through.
As some of the 12,563 fans started to head for the exits, the game's most controversial moment happened.
As Craig picked up the ball and drove into the box, he was challenged by Jack, who appeared to make contact with the ball. But Craig tumbled and referee Steven McLean pointed to the spot.
With the home fans still howling in protest, Craig stepped up and expertly sent Brown the wrong way.
For Aberdeen, the remaining few minutes were spent throwing the kitchen sink in the direction of the St Johnstone goal but the winner never came.",A controversial late penalty for St Johnstone secured a 1-1 draw for the visitors and denied Aberdeen the chance to cut the gap on Celtic to four points at the top of the Scottish Premiership.
38091816,"Armed forces have been killing Rohingya in Rakhine state, forcing many to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, says John McKissick of the UN refugee agency.
The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been conducting counter-insurgency operations since coordinated attacks on border guards in October.
It denies reports of atrocities.
A spokesman said the government was ""very, very disappointed"" by the comments.
Burmese officials say Rohingya are setting fire to their own houses in northern Rakhine state. The BBC cannot visit the area to verify what is occurring there, as journalists and aid workers have been barred.
The Rohingya, who number about one million, are seen by many of Myanmar's Buddhist majority as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
Although Bangladesh's official policy is not to allow in illegal entrants across the border, the foreign ministry has confirmed that thousands of Rohingya have already sought refuge in the country, while thousands more are reportedly gathering on the border.
Some are using smugglers to get into Bangladesh, while others have bribed border guards, according to Amnesty International.
Efforts to resolve the issue must focus on ""the root cause"" inside Myanmar, Mr McKissick, head of the UN refugee agency UNHCR in the Bangladeshi border town of Cox's Bazar, told BBC Bengali's Akbar Hossain.
He said the Myanmar military and Border Guard Police had ""engaged in collective punishment of the Rohingya minority"" after the murders of nine border guards on 9 October which some politicians blamed on a Rohingya militant group.
Security forces have been ""killing men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to cross the river"" into Bangladesh, Mr McKissick said.
""Now it's very difficult for the Bangladeshi government to say the border is open because this would further encourage the government of Myanmar to continue the atrocities and push them out until they have achieved their ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority in Myanmar,"" he said.
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is in a delicate position. She is Myanmar's de facto leader, but security is under the control of the autonomous armed forces.
If Ms Suu Kyi bows to international pressure and sets up a credible investigation into the alleged abuses in Rakhine state, she risks fracturing her relationship with the army. It could jeopardise the stability of her young government.
So for the last six weeks Ms Suu Kyi has kept her head firmly in the sand, avoiding journalists and press conferences.
When forced, she has commented that the military in Rakhine is operating according to the ""rule of law"". Few believe that to be the case.
While there are loud calls from overseas for action, most Burmese have very little sympathy for the Rohingya. The army's ""clearance operations"" against the ""violent attackers"" of Rakhine state appear to have strong popular support, putting Ms Suu Kyi under very little domestic pressure.
Myanmar's presidential spokesman Zaw Htay said Mr McKissick ""should maintain his professionalism and his ethics as a United Nations officer because his comments are just allegations"".
""He should only speak based on concrete and strong evidence on the ground,"" he said.
On Wednesday, the Bangladesh foreign ministry summoned Myanmar's ambassador to express ""deep concern"" over the military operation in northern Rakhine state.
It said ""desperate people"" were crossing the border seeking safety and shelter and asked Myanmar to ""ensure the integrity of its border"".
Authorities in Bangladesh have been detaining and repatriating hundreds of fleeing Rohingya, which Amnesty International condemned as a violation of international law.
Bangladesh does not recognise Rohingya as refugees, and many of those fleeing Myanmar have been ""forced into hiding and are suffering a severe lack of food and medical care"", the rights group said.
Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers have arrived into Bangladesh from Myanmar in waves since at least the 1970s. There are some 33,000 registered Rohingya refugees living in Cox's Bazar's two camps, Kutupalong and Nayapara.
Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch released satellite images which it said showed that more than 1,200 homes had been razed in Rohingya villages over the past six weeks.
A massive security operation was launched last month after nine police officers were killed in co-ordinated attacks on border posts in Maungdaw.
Some government officials blamed a militant Rohingya group for the attacks. Security forces then sealed off access to Maungdaw district and launched a counter-insurgency operation.
Rohingya activists say more than 100 people have been killed and hundreds arrested amid the crackdown.
Soldiers have also been accused of serious human rights abuses, including torture, rape and executions, which the government has flatly denied.
It says militants have attacked helicopter gunships providing air support to troops.
The estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are seen by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship by the government despite many having lived there for generations.
Communal violence in Rakhine state in 2012 left scores dead and displaced more than 100,000 people, with many Rohingya still remaining in decrepit camps.
They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment.
Hundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having left Myanmar over decades.
Myanmar held its first openly contested election in 25 years last November, with Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning a landslide victory.
Though she is barred from the presidency due to a constitutional rule, Ms Suu Kyi, who serves as State Counsellor, is seen as de-facto leader.
But her government, led as it is by a former human rights icon, has faced international criticism over the dire situation in Rakhine state.
Rights groups have questioned why journalists and aid workers are not being allowed to enter northern Rakhine.
Presidential spokesman Zaw Htay says the international media is misreporting what is going on.","Myanmar is seeking the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Rohingya minority from its territory, a senior UN official has told the BBC."
35118791,"They are bound by a shared passion to bring out Balaknama (Voice of Children), an eight-page quarterly newspaper which focuses on children living and working on the streets.
It proudly calls itself the ""world's unique newspaper for and by street and working children"".
Eighteen-year-old Chandni, the newspaper's editor, joins the animated discussion over the content of the next edition of the paper whose circulation has gone up from 4,000 to 5,500 copies since she took over a year ago.
The reporters have either been street children or have worked as child labourers in Delhi and neighbouring states. They were rescued by Chetna, an NGO that works for the rehabilitation of street children.
By one estimate, more than 10 million children live on the streets and are forced into work in India.
From working as a street performer with her father to rag picking to support the family, Chandni's life has been a tale of grinding poverty.
The NGO's outreach programme enthused her to join a school and also gave her a modest stipend to keep her from going back to rag picking. It also trained her as a reporter.
""I am very proud of editing this paper because it's one of its kind in India. Children whose childhood have been robbed, have gone hungry, begged, been abused and forced to work write about other children who are going through similar tribulations,"" says Chandni.
""It's not only cathartic but also gives each one of us a sense of purpose. We can only become better from here.""
She manages a bureau of 14 reporters who cover Delhi and neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
Most reporters narrate their copies to colleagues in the Delhi office on the phone because they often have no access to e-mail or fax.
Chandni conducts two editorial meets every month to keep a sharp eye on the content.
The broadsheet is priced at two rupees (30 cents) and is financed and published by Chetna. But it has been struggling to find advertisers and has not received any funding from the government.
Shanno, 19, is a fifth-grade school dropout. Working long hours and putting up with a ""drunk father"" was Shanno's life story.
Today she is studying for a degree in social work and hopes to have a career as a social activist. She also trains other reporters at the newspaper.
""We did a sample survey of street and working children in Delhi in November and managed to track down 1,320 children living on the streets and working as labourers,"" she says.
""We wanted to tell the police and the government that a proper count of street children was possible. If we can do it with limited resources, so can they when they have all the manpower and resources available to them.""
""There's been talk of a survey of street children to be conducted by the Delhi government and also the police but nothing has come of it so far,"" she adds.
Shambhu, who also works at the newspaper, says he faced a lot of opposition and endured threats while doing the survey.
""We had to face a lot of opposition and even threats when we went to talk to children working in restaurants and hotels because their employers were belligerent. But we firmly told them that we will call the child helpline number if they did not allow us talk to the children,"" he says.
Reaching out to children stuck in private homes, restaurants and factories gave a sense of purpose to 15-year-old Chandni (junior).
She echoes the pain and horror of many nameless children in the stories that she files for the paper. Chandni (junior) is slated to take over as the next editor of the newspaper.
""I want to increase the reach of our newspaper and make it a profit making venture. It's the voice of all of us who have survived hardships on the streets, in other people's homes and sweat shops and can now speak for many others who continue to struggle. Their silence must be heard,"" she says.","A group of street children are busy in an unusual editorial meeting in a house in the Indian capital, Delhi."
39388860,"Sone Aluko poked home the only goal of the game to lift the Cottagers into the play-off places.
The scrambled finish ended Rotherham's three-season stay in the second-tier.
Fulham keeper David Button had earlier denied Lee Frecklington and Jon Taylor, while Danny Ward also went close.
Ward wasted the best chance of the first half, sending a free header wide, while Taylor was foiled moments after Chris Martin wasted Fulham's first real chance.
The goal which inflicted an eighth straight defeat on Rotherham, and sent them down, was an untidy one, with defender Darnell Fisher and goalkeeper Lewis Price initially blocking efforts before Aluko finished from close range.
Fulham's first win in three games was enough to move them above Sheffield Wednesday after the Owls were held to a 1-1 draw against Barnsley earlier in the day.
Since a 2-1 defeat by Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield on 27 September, Rotherham have been bottom of the Championship.
In total, the Millers have spent just 26 days of the 239 this season outside the relegation places.
Caretaker boss Paul Warne was the man to oversee relegation, having taken charge of the club in November after Kenny Jackett -  who succeeded Alan Stubbs - resigned after just 39 days at the helm.
Rotherham interim boss Paul Warne: ""There's a little bit of embarrassment. I took the reins a few months ago and I haven't been good enough to get the results to keep us up and that is on my head.
""The performances have been okay at times but we haven't got that strength in depth. But that's my fault, it's not anyone else's.
""I don't think anyone thought before today that we would stay up, we weren't going to win eight on the spin. So to have relegated next to our name isn't too much of a shock.""
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: ""It is a great step for us towards where we want to be.
""It was a very tough game. I am pleased because I have missed some 1-0 wins, so to get the goal and then finish with a clean sheet is pleasing and it is important news for us.
""We tried to be focused on our job and thinking about what we can do.
""We weren't thinking about Sheffield Wednesday or about other teams. Our focus is on us in this crucial part of the competition and getting as many points as is possible for us.""

40242226,"She was speaking after what she called ""constructive"" talks with Sinn FÃ©in about restoring power-sharing.
Devolved government in Northern Ireland broke down in January and there has been political deadlock following a snap assembly election in March.
The deadline for an agreement to be reached has been extended to 29 June.
If no executive is formed, Secretary of State James Brokenshire has warned Northern Ireland may face direct rule.
Brushing aside calls from Sinn Fein and the SDLP for him to be replaced by an ""independent broker"", Mr Brokenshire said the British government was ""very clear"" on its responsibilities to ""act fairly to the benefit to all communities"".
Mrs Foster is due to meet the prime minster on Tuesday to discuss the formation of a DUP-supported Conservative government at Westminster.
A senior minister has said he is ""optimistic"" a deal would be reached to allow a proposed Tory minority government to get its legislative programme through the Commons.
Mr Brokenshire said those negotiations were ""entirely separate from our intent and desire to see devolution restored here"".
But Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams said no deal between the Conservatives and the DUP would be good for Northern Ireland.
And Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said earlier it ""would be kind to describe Mr Brokenshire as delusional"".
""His government won't exist unless the DUP allow it to exist and the fact that they will be dependent on them conflicts him even more,"" he said.
But Mrs Foster rejected Sinn Fein's accusations the Good Friday Agreement would be compromised if her party entered into a deal to support a minority Conservative government.
She said her MPs had a right to participate in the government process at Westminster.
""I think this is a tremendous opportunity not just for this party but for Northern Ireland in terms of the nation, and we're looking forward to playing our part in that,"" she said.
But SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Northern Ireland politics was ""in a very, very bad place"".
""Arlene Foster has got the British government over a barrel - we will not accept that, and the taoiseach should not accept that either.""
The Alliance Party echoed the SDLP and Sinn FÃ©in's concerns that such a partnership could make power-sharing at Stormont more difficult.
Mr Brokenshire and Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan both attended Monday's talks with Northern Ireland's five main parties.
Mr Flanagan said the Irish government had two key priorities in the talks:
Leo Varadkar, the new leader of Ireland's Fine Gael party, has said he will raise with Theresa May the importance of impartiality in the Stormont talks.
He said it was important that the two governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, should not be too close to either unionism, or nationalists and republicans.
Mr Varadkar is expected to become Irish prime minister later this week in a parliamentary vote on Enda Kenny's successor.
The Prime Minister will meet with Arlene Foster on Tuesday, well aware that a deal with the DUP is the only chance the Conservatives have of staying in power.
If an agreement is reached it is likely to be what is known as a confidence and supply arrangement where the DUP would support the Tories on key votes like the Queen's speech, the budget or a vote of no confidence.
Critics say the move endangers the peace process and the government will not be an honest broker in Northern Ireland.
If a deal is done it will propel Arlene Foster's party onto the national stage and give her MPs an influence they could not have anticipated during the election campaign.
Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, the executive must be jointly run by unionists and nationalists, with the largest party putting forward a candidate for first minister.
Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness quit as deputy first minister in January in protest against the DUP's handling of a botched green energy scheme.
The party said it would not share power with DUP leader Arlene Foster as first minister until the conclusion of a public inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.
Mr McGuinness, who had been suffering from a rare heart condition, died earlier this year.","Arlene Foster has said a deal between her Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservatives could be a ""tremendous opportunity"" for Northern Ireland."
37314772,"Reds boss Jurgen Klopp was a winner at Stamford Bridge last season - and this was three points Liverpool fully merited to add to a triumph at Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season and a draw at Tottenham.
Liverpool were keen to build on the 4-1 thrashing of champions Leicester City at Anfield last weekend and they over-ran Chelsea to take control by half-time through Dejan Lovren's close range finish and captain Jordan Henderson's spectacular 25-yard strike.
Chelsea, with Â£32m defender David Luiz making his first appearance since returning to Chelsea from Paris St-Germain as replacement for the injured John Terry, pulled one back through Diego Costa but their laboured performance deserved nothing from this game.
Klopp's Liverpool is looking more like the sort of team their manager wants with every passing week as they produced another impressive performance.
Liverpool may yet remain on the margins of the title race but victories such as this, added to the excellent 4-3 win at Arsenal and a fine display in the 1-1 draw at Tottenham, will certainly see those at Anfield exuding quiet confidence.
Klopp was without influential forward Roberto Firmino here, ruled out with a groin problem, a severe blow as the Brazilian's work-rate, tactical awareness and goal threat has made him a vital component in Liverpool's success against the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United since the German's arrival.
It made little difference as Liverpool's prodigious work ethic, a staple of Klopp's style, pressured Chelsea into submission and gave them a constant goal threat as well as a defensive shield.
Two of Liverpool's big summer buys made an impact, with Sadio Mane giving them real pace and menace and Georginio Wijnaldum offering a steadying presence in midfield.
Meanwhile, the reliable James Milner illustrated once again why Klopp was not prepared to answer demands to rush into the market and buy a left-back.
Liverpool are still a work in progress and will still have questions to answer when they produce performances such as that which saw them lose at Burnley earlier this season - but once again they showed at Stamford Bridge that the charismatic Klopp is taking them in the right direction.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Chelsea's decision to agree a new one-year contract with captain Terry may have been belated, after a spell when it looked like his Stamford Bridge career was coming to a close.
On this evidence, however, it looks a very wise move because the 35-year-old centre-back still has a key role to play as Chelsea make their latest managerial transition into the Conte era.
Chelsea, without Terry, lacked direction and leadership in defence on Friday, even though they were able to re-introduce the returning Luiz as Terry sat this one out through injury.
The ex-England captain is not only still a formidable defender but he is the consummate organiser and would surely have lessened the chances of the shambolic marking that left Lovren in splendid isolation to turn in Liverpool's opening goal.
Conte's animated touchline body language screamed out frustration as Chelsea struggled to exert any sustained pressure on Liverpool and were far too ponderous for long periods.
He made a good start at Chelsea after leaving his job as Italy coach, albeit needing late winners from Costa against West Ham United and Watford before a convincing win against Burnley.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The size of his task was hinted at by the way they lost control of a game they were winning before drawing at Swansea City, and here they were second best throughout.
As stated before, they miss Terry and experienced figures such as Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic are starting to look frayed around the edges.
Costa cannot dig them out of trouble every time and there was even a question mark over Conte's approach, taking 83 minutes to make a change when it was clear something needed to be done.
When it came, it was a triple substitution as Victor Moses, Pedro and Cesc Fabregas came on for Willian, Oscar and Matic, although there was widespread surprise that Â£33m striker Michy Batshuayi was not given an opportunity.
Conte, perhaps understandably, is learning the ways of the Premier League. And there is plenty for him to learn at Chelsea.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:
""We conceded the goals in a strange way. They took the free-kick quickly for the first goal and it was a great shot from a long distance for the second but if we are in the right position he must not receive the ball unmarked.
""When you want to think like a great team you must pay attention in every moment.
""We played with good intensity and anger in the second half. We scored a goal and could have scored another with Diego Costa. We played a good second half.
""I must work more to improve my players. Defeats are never good. We know this, we must work and keep our concentration.""
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:
""It was a satisfying win of course. From the first second we had unbelievably good movement.  We were quick in mind. We did really well. We deserved the lead at half-time.
""We have to learn how to manage the game plan. So often this season Chelsea scored in the last few seconds with a direct style. But I can't remember too many chances from them. We had a few moments where we weren't so good but that's normal against a good team.
""We played football like hell. It was really nice to watch. In the second half it was a bit more difficult. After their goal, we managed it well.""
Liverpool goalscorer Dejan Lovren:
""It is always a tough game here but I thought we did brilliantly. In the first half, I thought it was our best football of the season.
""It's always good to score but the most important thing is the three points. The spirit is perfect so we just need to keep working.""
Both teams are back in action on Tuesday, when they play in EFL Cup third-round ties.
Chelsea go to Premier League champions Leicester, while Liverpool visit Championship side Derby County.

38214736,"So when they do score a significant victory they announce it from the rooftops.
Few of us will forget the hilarious, ear-splitting screams of the Icelandic commentator at the European football championships this summer, communicating his delight at Iceland's victory over England.
Jubilant does not quite do it justice.
As part of the BBC's 100 Women series, I have come to Iceland to find out why this country is considered the best place to live and work as a woman.
It appears women's independence in Iceland has ancient roots.
I meet Svanhilden Hjaltadottir behind the till manning (or should it be womanning?) one of the many trendy gift stores in Reykjavik.
""We are like Vikings,"" she laughs. ""We are strong and we like to do things on our own.""
Anyone you chat to here in Reykjavik knows exactly where Iceland sits in the Global Gender Gap Index put together by the World Economic Forum - and it has been number one for a good few years.
The UK meanwhile languishes in 20th place.
There are a number of factors that make up Iceland's top global ranking. For instance, at 88% it has the highest rate of female participation in the workforce.
For 20 of the last 50 years the country has had a female head of state, 40% of company board members now have to be women - the impressive list of chart-topping statistics goes on.
88%
of working-age women are in employment
65% of university students are female
41% of MPs are women
1980 the year in which Vigdis Finnbogadottir (right) became the world's first democratically elected female head of state
Yet despite that historically powerful role, in the 1970s that did not translate to equality in the workforce until the women of Iceland took things into their own hands.
The first universal women's strike in Iceland happened on 24 October 1975.
Unlike protests in other parts of the world as well as thousands of women gathering in central Austurvollur, thousands more walked out of their workplaces and homes, leaving colleagues and family members to fend for themselves.
Some 90% of Iceland's female population went on all-out professional and domestic strike - and that made an impression. Within a few years Iceland had elected the world's first female head of state.
For those women like Ashildur Bragadottir, who were involved in what became known in Iceland as the first ""Women's Day Off"", it was the start of an economic as well as political process.
""I was at a young age then but remember the day clearly and can recall on feeling proud and a bit overwhelmed.
""Only five years later, or in the year 1980, Vigdis Finnbogadottir was the world's first female president democratically elected, and in the year 1982 the Women's list (Kvennalistinn) was formed.""
Of course Iceland has a tiny population, comparatively, but both men and women here have worked to ensure that motherhood and employment are not mutually exclusive.
High-quality, affordable nurseries, incentives for men to take parental leave and quotas on company boards have had a huge impact on the working life of women in Iceland.
While the vast majority of them have jobs, they still manage to have an average of two children each.
But for Ashildur's daughters, now in their late teens and early 20s, they feel there is still more to be done.
""Iceland is a small and well-educated nation and women's rights are something that is talked about in politics and in the media,"" says Unnur Jona, 21.
""We are brought up with the notion that we should have the same opportunities and rights as men, all the time and always, but we know that we aren't there yet. There is still an unexplained inequality with the gender and we still have far too few women's business leaders in general.""
BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre.
Other stories you might like:
'I married a man to keep my girlfriend'
'Adults are so obsessed with children they have no time for important things'
Who is on the BBC's 100 Women 2016 list?
Women in Iceland still earn about 14% less than men.
In the UK the figure is higher - a pay gap of about 18% exists between men and women in similar jobs.
So what do the women of Iceland intend to do about it? Strike, of course.
Each year they leave their workplaces and homes on 24 October and gather in Reykjavik's central square again. Not quietly hoping for change, but loudly demanding it.

29341850,"The Mangalyaan satellite was confirmed to be in orbit shortly after 0800, Indian time. It is, without doubt, a considerable achievement.
This is a mission that has been budgeted at 4.5bn rupees ($74m), which, by Western standards, is staggeringly cheap.
The American Maven orbiter that arrived at the Red Planet on Monday is costing almost 10 times as much.
Back in June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi even quipped that India's real-life Martian adventure was costing less than the make-believe Hollywood film Gravity.
Even Bollywood sci-fi movies like Ra.One cost a good chunk of what it has taken to get Mangalyaan to Mars.
$74m
Cost of India's Mangalyaan mission
$671m
Cost of Nasa's Maven Mars mission
Launched on 5 Nov  2013
Weighs  1,350kg
Closest point to Mars 366km
So how has India done it?  For sure, people costs are less in this populous nation, and the scientists and engineers working on any space mission are always the largest part of the ticket price.
Home-grown components and technologies have also been prioritised over expensive foreign imports.
But, in addition, India has been careful to do things simply.
""They've kept it small. The payload weighs only about 15kg. Compare that with the complexity in the payload in Maven and that will explain a lot about the cost,"" says Britain's Prof Andrew Coates, who will be a principal investigator on Europe's Mars rover in 2018.
""Of course, that reduced complexity suggests it won't be as scientifically capable, but India has been smart in targeting some really important areas that will complement what others are doing.""
Mangalyaan has gone equipped with an instrument that will try to measure methane in the atmosphere.
This is one of the hottest topics in Mars research right now, following previous, tantalising observations of the gas.
Earth's atmosphere contains billions of tonnes of methane, the vast majority of it coming from microbes, such as the organisms found in the digestive tracts of animals.
The speculation has been that some methane-producing bugs, or methanogens, could perhaps exist on Mars if they lived underground, away from the planet's harsh surface conditions.
It is a fascinating prospect.
So, even though Mangalyaan has a small payload, it will actually address some of the biggest questions at the Red Planet.
Western scientists are excited also to have the Indian probe on station.
Its measurements of other atmospheric components will dovetail very nicely with Maven and the observations being made by Europe's Mars Express.  ""It means we'll be getting three-point measurements, which is tremendous,"" says Prof Coates.
This will enable researchers to better understand how the planet lost the bulk of its atmosphere billions of years ago, and determine what sort of climate it could once have had, and whether or not it was conducive to life.
I have read a lot about the criticism of Mangalyaan and India's space programme.
There's an assumption among many, I guess, that space activity is somehow a plaything best left to wealthy industrial countries; that it can have no value to developing nations.
The money would be better spent on healthcare and improved sanitation, so the argument goes.
But what this position often overlooks is that investment in science and technology builds capability and capacity, and develops the sort of people who benefit the economy and society more widely.
Space activity is also a wealth generator. Some of the stuff we do up there pays for stuff down here.
The industrialised nations know it; that's one of the reasons they invest so heavily in space activity.
Consider just the UK.  It has dramatically increased its spending on space in recent years.
The government has even identified satellites as being one of the ""eight great technologies"" that can help rebalance the UK economy and drive it forward.
India wants a part of this action, too, and in Mangalyaan and its other satellite and rocket programmes, the nation is putting itself into a strong position in international markets for space products and services.",India's space programme has succeeded at the first attempt where others have failed - by sending an operational mission to Mars.
23366025,"Crammed with umbrella-wielding shoppers after a humid afternoon downpour, the 150-yard stretch of luxury stores is Hong Kong's answer to Bond Street or Fifth Avenue.
The designer brands that cluster along this street and those nearby cater to free-spending tourists from mainland China that have - in little more than a decade -transformed Causeway Bay and other shopping areas in the former British colony.
Gone are many of the grocers, tea houses and noodle vendors that give the city its unique character.
They have been squeezed out by rents that are twice as high as New York and four times higher than London.
And the city is beginning to ask whether the loss of these small businesses will alter the fabric of Hong Kong's streets and stifle entrepreneurship in the city.
""The local businesses that cater for local tastes - that's the real Hong Kong,"" says Andrew Sheng, president of the Fung Global Institute, a Hong Kong-based think tank.
""That's what Hong Kong people feel attached to, emotionally and culturally.""
One victim of the eye-watering rents is Ho Hung Kee, located just a short walk away from Russell Street.
For 39 years, customers sat cheek-by-jowl in the restaurant's tiny booths and tables slurping wonton noodles and congee infused with ginger and spring onions.
But at the end of May, the owners, Patty Ho and her husband, served their last bowl of  wonton noodles on the premises. They could not afford the monthly rent of Hong Kong $350,000 ($45,000; ÃÂ£30,000) sought by a new landlord.
""In Hong Kong, the rents are just crazy,"" says Ms Ho.
She believes the new tenant will be a pharmacy, selling medicine and baby milk formula that are often purchased by Chinese tourists.
Not far away, another traditional noodle joint that shut its doors in February is now a branch of Swiss watch retailer Rado.
In the days before its closure, the shop attracted hour-long queues of tourists and residents eager for a last meal.
In many respects, rising rents are nothing new in Hong Kong. The city has long been one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.
Yet other Asian cities facing similar constraints manage to preserve mom-and-pop shops, says Mr Sheng at the Fung Global Institute.
He says that landlords in Tokyo want to have ramen and sushi makers in their property and in Singapore, planning laws ensure that even the ritziest districts usually feature a ""hawker centre"" where tasty local food can be bought cheaply.

""The key question we need to ask is, is this inevitable or is this something we need as a community deal with?"" he says.
Jennifer Cheung, who closed her business selling customised leather shoes in January after more than eight years in operation, says high rents combined with short leases will discourage young people from starting up their own businesses.
A two or three-year lease is the norm, compared to five to 10 year tenancies in the UK.
""It's very discouraging for entrepreneurship,"" says Ms Cheung.
""I had good timing. When I started out my rent was less than HK$30,000 a month. Now you sign a contract and it's a million a year.""
Faced with a 60% jump in rent and staffing problems, Ms Cheung has decided to relaunch her business online.
""It will be a test but I have a strong niche and customer base.""
Joe Lin, senior director of Hong Kong Retail Services at CBRE Group, believes the tide of luxury brands filling up the city's streets is slowing.
In the first three months of this year, prime retail rents were up 8.8% from a year earlier but down from the double digit increases seen in the past three years.
The Chinese government is discouraging open displays of wealth among officials and this has made top tier luxury goods companies more cautious in their expansion plans, he says.
""The retail market is a little bit different. Starting from the second half of last year, they [Chinese tourists] have started to buy more mid-range products. The consumption pattern is changing.""
Perhaps evidence that the city's landlords might be getting too greedy is the fact that the sugary pink shop front of Shoegirl - Ms Cheung's business - is still unaltered.
The premises remain vacant months after her departure.
But Mr Lin says that the city's high rents are unlikely to change in the short term and smaller, independent businesses will continue to be displaced.
Ho Hung Kee won't disappear altogether.
The owners' son has opened a fancier restaurant bearing the same name on the 12th floor of a nearby shopping centre, hoping to cash in on the restaurant's recent inclusion in the city's Michelin Guide.
Ms Ho says she is looking forward to handing the reins to the next generation after years of working 12-hour days, seven days a week, but without a street-level shop front she doesn't know whether it will be a success.
""I'm not quite happy about it. This shop has a lot of memories,"" she says.
""We're the only wonton noodle shop with a Michelin star and we still have to move.""",Welcome to Russell Street - the world's most expensive shopping district.

Ranieri, 65, guided the Foxes to the title despite them being rated 5,000-1 shots at the start of the campaign.
Leicester are one point above the relegation zone with 13 matches left.
""After the euphoria of last season and being crowned champions, all I dreamt of was staying with Leicester. Sadly this was not to be,"" Ranieri said.
""The adventure was amazing and will live with me forever. My heartfelt thanks to everybody at the club, everybody who was part of what we achieved, but mostly to the supporters.

Ranieri's departure came less than 24 hours after Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Spanish side Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. The second leg is on 14 March.
On Saturday, Leicester were knocked out of the FA Cup by League One Millwall.
In explaining the club's decision, vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said ""long-term interests"" had been put above ""personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be"".
The Foxes took last season's Premier League title by 10 points but have won just five top-flight games this season, and could become the first defending champions since 1938 to be relegated.
They have lost their past five league matches and are the only side in the top four English divisions without a league goal in 2017.

Speaking earlier on Friday, Leicester caretaker boss Craig Shakespeare denied a player revolt led to Ranieri's sacking.
BBC Sport understands some players were summoned to meet the chairman after the defeat by Sevilla, and Ranieri's fate was sealed by the negative reaction.
""There was a lot of frustration because of the results, but he had not lost the dressing room,"" Shakespeare said.
""A lot of the talk of unrest has been speculation. I've not had one problem with the players.
""I always feel sorry when people lose their jobs. My relationship with Claudio has been fine all along.
""I spoke to him last night and he thanked me for my support throughout. It was not brief and we exchanged views. A lot of what we said will stay private.""
Shakespeare and first-team coach Mike Stowell will take charge of the squad until a new manager is appointed.
Ranieri's compatriots Paolo Benetti and Andrea Azzalin, both key members of his coaching staff, have left the club.
Ex-Manchester City and Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini and Nigel Pearson, who Ranieri replaced in 2015, are the early bookmakers' favourites to take over at Leicester.
Former Birmingham boss Gary Rowett - a one-time Foxes player who is around fifth favourite - told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I'm sat at home waiting for the right opportunity to come along. Leicester would be an amazing one, but it's still raw for everyone.""
Rowett, who played for Leicester between 2000 and 2002, was controversially sacked by Birmingham in December, and replaced by former Chelsea striker Gianfranco Zola.
""I played there for two years so I've had good experiences at Leicester and it's an excellent club. It would be a daunting one for anyone and a fantastic opportunity for someone,"" he added.

After the euphoria of last season and being crowned Premier League champions, all I dreamt of was staying with Leicester City, the club I love, for always.
Sadly this was not to be. I wish to thank my wife Rosanna and all my family for their never-ending support during my time at Leicester.
My thanks go to Paolo and Andrea, who accompanied me on this wonderful journey. To Steve Kutner [Ranieri's agent] and Franco Granello [his Italian agent] for bringing me the opportunity to become a champion.
Mostly I have to thank Leicester City Football Club. The adventure was amazing and will live with me forever.
Thank you to all the journalists and the media who came with us and enjoyed reporting on the greatest story in football.
My heartfelt thanks to everybody at the club, all the players, the staff, everybody who was there and was part of what we achieved. But mostly to the supporters. You took me into your hearts from day one and loved me. I love you too.

27260040,"Detectives were granted a 48-hour extension on Friday evening by a judge.
Mr Adams, 65, denies allegations that he was involved in the abduction and murder of the mother-of-ten.
He has been held for questioning since voluntarily presenting himself at Antrim police station on Wednesday.
Mr Adams is the former MP for West Belfast and is currently an elected representative for County Louth in the Republic of Ireland.
An initial 48-hour deadline to either charge or release him was due to expire at 20:00 BST on Friday, but the police successfully applied for more time to question him.
Mr Adams appeared in court via video link, as his lawyers contested the police's application for an extension under the Terrorism Act 2000.
Detectives could have asked for five more days to question Mr Adams, but instead applied to hold him until Sunday evening.
Earlier on Friday, his party colleague Martin McGuinness told a news conference: ""Yesterday, I said that the timing of the arrest of Gerry Adams was politically motivated.
""Today's decision by the PSNI to seek an extension confirms me in my view.""
Mr McGuinness, who is Northern Ireland deputy first minister, said the detention of Mr Adams was ""a very, very serious situation"".
He said Sinn FÃ©in supported the progressive elements within the PSNI.
However, he added: ""There is a cabal within the PSNI who have a different agenda, a negative and destructive agenda to both the peace process and to Sinn FÃ©in.""
He said Sinn FÃ©in had been told this by ""very senior members of the PSNI"" who had coined the phrase the 'dark side'.
""Am I angry? Yes I am, but it's a very controlled anger,"" he said.
In regards to Sinn FÃ©in's support for policing in Northern Ireland, he said that would continue if the situation with Mr Adams is resolved in a satisfactory manner.
""If it doesn't, we will have to review that situation.""
When pressed if this meant Sinn FÃ©in would withdraw support for the police if Mr Adams was charged, he said: ""We're not taking any decision at this time, about anything.""
Mr McGuinness added: ""I believe Gerry Adams will be totally and absolutely exonerated.""
Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford of the Alliance Party said: ""If there are dark forces within policing, I can see no sign of dark forces.""
Mr Ford, who was first appointed minister when policing and justice powers were devolved to Stormont in 2010, said: ""I see a police force with very high levels of confidence, higher than the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) or many forces in Great Britain.
""I see a police force carrying out its duties properly and appropriately, following up evidential opportunities where they present themselves and operating in conjunction with the community across a range of issues.""
Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt said: ""It is one thing to scrutinise the police - it is totally unacceptable for their support for police to be conditional on getting political policing in relation to republicans, which Martin McGuinness seems to be suggesting.""
Dolores Kelly of the nationalist SDLP said: ""For Sinn FÃ©in to threaten to withdraw support from the PSNI because an investigation is not going the way they want it completely unacceptable.""
On Thursday, Northern Ireland First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said: ""I would suggest to you that it would be political policing if the PSNI had not questioned those that were deemed to have been involved in any way.""
Mrs McConville, a 37-year-old widow and mother of 10, was abducted and shot by the IRA. Her body was recovered from a beach in County Louth in 2003.
She is one of Northern Ireland's Disappeared, those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles.
She was kidnapped in front of her children after being wrongly accused of being an informer - a claim that was dismissed after an official investigation by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman.
The widow was held at one or more houses before being shot and buried in secret.
The IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and buried at secret locations nine of the Disappeared.
Sixteen people are listed as ""disappeared"" by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, which was established in 1999 by a treaty between the British and Irish governments.
Despite extensive searches, the remains of seven of them have not been found.
Last month, Ivor Bell, 77, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder.
There have also been a number of other arrests over the murder recently.",Police in Northern Ireland have been given more time to question Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams in connection with the 1972 murder of Jean McConville.
36785549,"Some paint her as a tough negotiator in the mould of Margaret Thatcher, while others point to her greater concern for social cohesion.
Most writers focus on her forthcoming negotiations with the European Union, but the parallel leadership struggle in the Labour Party also attracts mostly bewildered attention from observers abroad.
Much of the European press sees Mrs May as a ""moderate pro-European"" facing the paradoxical task of negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union.
The London correspondent of France's Le Monde, Philippe Bernard, says she is ""austere, determined and politically astute"", and will be a ""formidable negotiator"" in talks with Brussels.
He draws parallels between her ""irresistible rise"" and that of another cleric's daughter, German Chancellor Angela Merkel:
""Neither have time for trivialities... both are liberal conservatives of a pragmatic rather than ideological bent,"" he says.
He expects her to ""remake the British political landscape"" by addressing the ""social despair that underpinned the Brexit vote"", especially given her ""good fortune"" in facing an opposition Labour Party ""on the verge of collapse"".
Enrico Franceschini, the London correspondent of Italy's La Repubblica, thinks she might find the appeal of an early election ""irresistible... given that the Labour Party is even more divided than the Conservatives"".
Germany's popular Bild tabloid also sees similarities with Mrs Merkel, dubbing them the ""Brexit duo who have to save what can be saved"" from the European relationship.
On the other hand, Der Spiegel says Mrs May could find the chancellor less of a partner, reporting ""Merkel's chilly message"" that Britain should ""not expect concessions"".
France's Le Figaro sees Europe ""pressing Theresa May"" to begin talks before crucial French and German elections in 2017, but warns that ""Margaret Thatcher's heir doesn't look like she's going to be rushed into anything"".
But Spain's ABC daily fears that Mrs May's caution could simply be a case of ""not having a clear plan to heal the European wound"".
France's leftwing Liberation pays more attention to the woes of the opposition.
British affairs analyst Olivier Esteves says Labour is partly to blame for the Brexit vote, because its failure in government either to control or explain EU migration ""abandoned"" the white working class to the Eurosceptic right.
""The Labour elite are winners in a silent class war of globalisation that had violent social consequences. They were unable to explain immigration to their traditional voters, because they live on another planet,"" he concludes.
Nor does Ralf Sotscheck, the British affairs commentator of the left-wing Berlin paper Tageszeitung, have many words of comfort for Labour.
He says the Tories have stolen a march on them by getting Mrs May into position so quickly, leaving the ""Blairite wing to ruin Labour"".
Spain's El Pais agrees that the government is radiating consensus while ""Labour continues to dig its own grave"".
France's Tribune financial weekly sees Mrs May's most pressing task as being one of ""reconciliation"", to ensure that the threats of recession and Brexit do not lead to stronger separatist moves in pro-Remain Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Rafael Ramos, the London correspondent of Barcelona's La Vanguardia, agrees that the post-Brexit turmoil in the two major parties could lead to a ""great British revolution of the 21st Century"".
Most press profiles inevitably mention Mrs May's striking taste in footwear, prompting Friederike Zoe Grasshoff of Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung to complain that such coverage is ""as sexist as it is eccentric"".
""She is about to take over as prime minister, and the big question is - wearing which shoes,"" Ms Grasshoff complains, although she does acknowledge that Mrs May might be able to cheer herself up during those all-night Brexit talks with the reflection that ""at least I got the shoes right"".
Further afield, Russian commentators are full of praise for Theresa May, although one tells the official Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper that she is likely only to be an ""interim"" prime minister without Mrs Thatcher's impact.
Pakistan's The Nation also sees the danger of Scottish secession, adding that ""Britain should be thankful that they have a prospective prime minister who is willing to roll up her sleeves and get to work immediately"".
India's Hindustan Times says the ""cricket-loving"" Mrs May is expected to ""continue Cameron's focus on India, particularly given that the Brexit camp privileged trade ties with India, China and the Commonwealth after leaving the European Union"".
Sebastian Mallaby writes in the Washington Post that Theresa May is a ""true conservative, although of a refreshing kind"", and sees her socially-concerned approach and hostility to banking excesses as likely to make ""Britain the place for pro-market progressives everywhere to watch"".
But Helen Lewis, the deputy editor of Britain's New Statesman magazine, tells the New York Times that Mrs May's pragmatism is unlikely to ""mollify her ardently Eurosceptic colleagues"" in the Conservative Party.
""If Brexit does not mean Brexit, their long knives will be sharpened,"" she warns.

35976228,"On Monday, a court heard the woman bought two types of drugs online, took them and miscarried on 12 July 2014.
Her housemate told the BBC that she and another housemate rang the police for advice.
The 1967 Abortion Act does not apply to Northern Ireland.
Abortion is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health.
The woman at the centre of the case has said, through her solicitor, that she does not want to speak publicly.
In a statement, her lawyer, Mary Haughey said: ""My client is relieved that the proceedings are now concluded and she wishes to put the matter behind her and move on with her life.""
Another woman - unconnected to this case - has been describing her experience of taking abortion pills.
On Wednesday, the housemate told the BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show she had been visiting relatives when the woman at the centre of the court case, who was 19 at the time, took the tablets.
Abortion law in Northern Ireland
â¢ The laws covering abortion in Northern Ireland are the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, and the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 1945. In the vast majority of circumstances, is a criminal offence in Northern Ireland to have or perform an abortion.
â¢ The only exceptions are to save a woman's life, or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
â¢  Many women who do not fit in these categories travel from Northern Ireland each year to have an abortion in other parts of the UK.
â¢ In England, Wales and Scotland access to abortion is covered by the 1967 Abortion Act. That permits terminations up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in certain circumstances.
â¢ It is also allowed over 24 weeks if there is a grave risk to the life of the woman, evidence of severe foetal abnormality; or risk of grave physical and mental injury to the woman.
She said she had been aware of the pregnancy. When she returned the following day she came across the foetus.
""I was putting rubbish out in the bin and realised that must be it,"" she said.
""We saw the wee baby and I was like 'oh my word'. You would never want to see it in your life. It was a full wee proper baby.""
The housemate, who also spoke to the Belfast Telegraph, said the woman ""begged and pleaded"" for them not to tell anyone.
""It wasn't our decision to make. We just thought we can't do anything, it's not our place to say anything,"" she said.
""About a week went by, the guilt of a baby in the bin was eating us up.
""We actually rang the police for advice. Whenever the police came it turned into something massive. We didn't actually think it would have gone so far.""
During the trial, the court heard the woman could not afford to travel to England for a termination.
She was was given a three-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, after admitting two offences - procuring her own abortion by using a poison, and of supplying a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage.
On Tuesday, an abortion group called for the case to be brought back to the appeals court.
Bernadette Smyth from Precious Life said she was ""very concerned about the judgement"" and was ""very hopeful that this case will be reviewed"".
However, a human rights organisation said it was appalled by the woman's conviction.
Amnesty International's Northern Ireland director, Patrick Corrigan, said: ""A woman who needs an abortion is not a criminal - the law should not treat her as such."" ,",A housemate of a woman given a suspended prison sentence after buying drugs to terminate her pregnancy said she contacted police over the guilt she felt seeing the foetus in a bin.
27050779,"Berlin-based Security Research Labs fooled the equipment using a mould it had previously created to spoof the sensor on Apple's iPhone 5S.
The researchers said they were concerned that thieves could exploit the flaw in Samsung's device to trigger money transfers via PayPal.
The payments firm played down the risk.
""While we take the findings from Security Research Labs [SRL] very seriously, we are still confident that fingerprint authentication offers an easier and more secure way to pay on mobile devices than passwords or credit cards,"" it said.
It added that even if users were hacked it would cover their losses.
A spokesman for Samsung was unable to comment.
SRL created its hack by lifting a real fingerprint from a smartphone screen and then carrying out a fairly elaborate process to create a mould out of glue and graphite spray. This was then swiped across the sensor that sits in the phone's home button.
""The fingerprint mould was actually one I made for the Apple device back in September,"" project manager Ben Schlabs told the BBC.
""All I had to do was take it out of the reject pile as it wasn't one of the ones that ended up working on the iPhone 5S for whatever reason.
""It was the first one I tried and it worked immediately on the S5.""
Although the fake fingerprint proved easy to use, Mr Schlabs added that he was concerned that Samsung's software would not lock out thieves who had less luck, allowing them to make repeated attempts.
""Samsung could have enforced a password [lock-out] after five failed swipe attempts,"" he said.
""But the way it works is that if it fails five times and asks for a password, if you just turn the screen off and back on again you can have another try.""
This is not true of the iPhone 5S.
While Apple currently limits its fingerprint scanner to unlocking the iPhone and verifying purchases in its own online store, Samsung has allowed its sensor to be used by third-party apps that add its Pass API (application program interface) to their code.
PayPal's mobile app is the first to take advantage of this. The software can be used to send and request money and reveal past transactions.
SRL acknowledged that the fingerprint scanner made it simpler to access, but criticised the company for not requiring a second form of authentication, such as a Pin code.
However, PayPal said Galaxy S5 users should not be deterred from using the feature.
""The scan unlocks a secure cryptographic key that serves as a password replacement for the phone,"" it said.
""We can simply deactivate the key from a lost or stolen device, and you can create a new one.
""PayPal also uses sophisticated fraud and risk management tools to try to prevent fraud before it happens. However, in the rare instances that it does, you are covered by our purchase protection policy.""
Tech blog Engadget agreed that users should not be too concerned.
""The odds are low that a street thief will get past your phone's defences, or that a talented hacker will get in before you've had a chance to remotely wipe your content,"" it reported.
But Mr Schlabs said that did not mean the risk of fingerprint hacks could be ignored.
""If you think into the future, once ATMs have fingerprint scanners and once heads of state start using fingerprint authentication it's going to become a lot more attractive,"" he said.
""Our method is pretty rudimentary and has been around for at least a decade and it worked on a phone that was only released last week.
""Once people develop better or faster methods, or once there are fingerprint databases of images that get leaked, it's definitely a concern.""",The fingerprint sensor on Samsung's Galaxy S5 handset has been hacked less than a week after the device went on sale.

About 80 mosques accused of ""spreading venom"" will close within a week, he said.
Authorities say most of the victims in Friday's attack near Sousse were Britons. The gunman was shot dead.
Follow the latest developments on our live page.
He was identified as Seifeddine Rezgui, a student who was not previously known to authorities, officials said.
Five Britons were confirmed dead and the Foreign Office warned the death toll could rise.
Tunisians, Germans, Belgians, French and at least one Irish citizen were also among those killed in the attack, which was claimed by Islamic State (IS). Thirty-six people are injured, officials say.
It was the second major attack on tourists in Tunisia since March, when militants killed 22 people, mainly foreigners, at Bardo museum in Tunis.
Speaking at a news conference in Tunis, Mr Essid said some mosques outside government control were spreading ""their propaganda and their venom to promote terrorism"" and would be shut down.
Mr Essid also vowed to act against parties and groups ""acting outside the constitution"" - such action could range from a warning to closure.
He said army reservists would be deployed at sensitive sites to ensure such attacks could not happen again.
One survivor told how her fiance, a Welsh tourist, was shot three times as he used his body as a shield to protect her.
""He took a bullet for me,"" said Saera Wilson. ""I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started.
""It was the bravest thing I've ever known. But I just had to leave him under the sunbed because the shooting just kept on coming.
""I ran back, past bodies on the beach to reach our hotel. It was chaos - there was a body in the hotel pool and it was just full of blood.
Welsh tourist was human shield
Most of the dead 'were Britons'
""The country is under threat; the government is under threat,"" Mr Essid said.
""Without the co-operation of everyone and a show of unity, we cannot win this war. We have won some battles and lost others, but our objective is to win the war"".
However, many Tunisians are asking why stricter security measures had not already been put in place following the attack on the Bardo museum, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Tunis.
Security officials said the attacker, who had posed as a swimmer but was carrying a rifle under a parasol, started shooting on the beach before entering the Hotel Imperial Marhaba, continuing to shoot.
A British holidaymaker, Steve Johnson, told the BBC: ""We were just lying on the beach as usual and... we heard what we thought at first was fireworks.
""But it was soon pretty obvious... that it was firearms that were being discharged and people were screaming and starting to run.""
Another holidaymaker, named only as Danny, said he and his wife had sought refuge in an office when the shooting started.
""We hid in there for about forty-five minutes to an hour, I think,"" he told the BBC.
""We could hear guns and grenades and explosions and all sorts of things...
""I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye thinking that that was going to be the end.""
IS said it was behind Friday's attack on what it called a ""den of vice"".
It identified the gunman by the nom de guerre of Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani. Social media accounts close to the group showed pictures of him.
At the scene: Rana Jawad, BBC News, Port El Kantaoui
Tourists gathered in the lobby of the Imperial Marhaba consoling each other. Most were thankful they had survived and described a day where they faced their worst fears: not seeing their children again back home or losing a loved one before their eyes.
A woman sat in alone in a corner silently crying with her packed luggage sitting beside her. So many here were frustrated at having to stay at the scene of the attack tonight.
These are sobering times, but the people of Sousse remain defiant: they are socialising with friends and family, and large parts of the city are still lit up on what is arguably its darkest day yet.
Who could be behind Tunisia attack?
Could attacks be connected?
Local media reported a second suspected attacker had been arrested, but this has not been confirmed.
IS had urged followers to step up assaults during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
Many of the tourists in hotels affected by the attack left the country overnight, with tour operators arranging special flights to take them home.
Friday's attack was the deadliest in Tunisia's recent history. The country has seen militant Islamists gain strength since the overthrow of long-serving ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in in 2011.
Democratic elections after Ben Ali's removal saw the moderate Islamist Ennahda party take power before the secularist Nidaa Tounes government won a parliamentary poll in October.
However, neither party has been able effectively to combat Islamist violence - which has been made worse by conflict in neighbouring Libya and by Tunisian fighters returning home after joining Islamist campaigns in Iraq and Syria.

Read our terms and conditions.",Tunisia's Prime Minister Habib Essid has announced a clampdown on security after an attack on a holiday resort in which 38 people were killed.
40602386,"It has also criticised the ""confusion"" surrounding Â£500m of future spending commitments.
The comments come in a written submission to Holyrood's Health and Sport Committee.
The Scottish government said it had already committed to investing ""a further Â£500m in primary care by the end of this parliament"".
The Royal College of GPs (RSCP) called on the Scottish government to say exactly how much it would spend on general practice in the next four years.
It follows a statement by Health Secretary Shona Robison after the government announced that its share of health spending would be increased to 11% of the overall health budget by 2021.
Ms Robison said: ""This forms the first stage of the Scottish government's commitment to provide an extra Â£250m in direct support of general practice per year by 2021 - increasing the overall investment in primary care by Â£500m.""
The RCGP said Scotland ""does not yet have understanding of what 'in direct support' may mean and the point has been raised with Scottish government that the term is too broad and lacks sufficient clarity"".
It added: ""General practice is in severe need of a clear, positive future, illustrated by adequate governmental investment, if it is to attract sufficient numbers of medical graduates to general practice specialty training.
""If the long-standing underfunding and confusion that we are currently experiencing is to continue, we will keep witnessing a considerable number of general practices closing and transferring the running of their practices to Health Boards due to insufficient resource through which to remain solvent.
""Patients will continue to be found queuing outside practices for the uncertain opportunity merely to register with a GP. It is a major deficit to bear such long-standing underfunding and confusion.""
Responding to the RCGP's submission, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""As the First Minister announced last year, a further Â£500m will be invested in primary care by the end of this parliament.
""This spending increase in primary care, to 11% of the frontline NHS budget, will support the development of a multi-disciplinary approach, with increased staffing as well as investment in GP services and health centres.
""Health Secretary Shona Robison recently set out that Â£250m of this new investment will be in direct support of general practice, helping to transform the way services are delivered in the community - an approach that was agreed with the British Medical Association.
""In this financial year, over Â£71m of that funding is to support general practice by improving recruitment and retention, reducing workload, developing new ways of delivering services and covering pay and expenses.""
Scottish Labour said the RCGP's comments were ""absolutely damning"".
The party's health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""Nicola Sturgeon has promised to boost the proportion of spending on GPs and it now appears she is going to renege on that promise.
""The importance of GP surgeries cannot be stressed enough. Particularly as we face an ageing population, with people living longer, primary care will only become more and more important.
""The reality is that under the SNP our health service is not prepared for this.
""We would do things differently. Labour's government-in-waiting in Westminster would hugely increase the money available to our NHS as part of our plan to create a society that works for the many, not the few.""
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs branded the government's spending plans ""a funding con"".
He said: ""Nicola Sturgeon happily stood with GPs and backed their campaign for an extra Â£500m to be directly invested in general practice.
""Now this has been cut in half, and the SNP is offering some waffle about the money being spent more generally.
""It's no wonder doctors are furious about this deception.
""The nationalists were happy to lap up the support of GPs when this commitment was made, but now seem to have completely u-turned on that promise.""","The Royal College of GPs has accused the Scottish government of ""long-standing underfunding"" of GP practices."
38504049,"Nathan Redmond's cool finish from Jay Rodriguez's pass gave Saints a crucial lead to take to Anfield on 25 January - but Southampton can count themselves unlucky not to be in complete control of this battle for a place at Wembley.
Liverpool's much-criticised goalkeeper Loris Karius was one of very few in Jurgen Klopp's side to distinguish himself amid a shocking performance, making two fine first-half saves from goalscorer Redmond.
Karius's one-handed save from Redmond right on half-time was vital but he was helpless late on as the same player threatened once more, Liverpool enjoying more good fortune as his effort came back off the bar.
Southampton's recent form has been indifferent but manager Claude Puel will have been delighted with their display at St Mary's.
After a brief early spell of Liverpool pressure, when Roberto Firmino tested Fraser Forster, Southampton were completely untroubled throughout an impressive performance.
Saints were sharp in the tackle, more assured in possession and a continual threat through Redmond and the industrious Rodriguez.
They will be left, however, with a tinge of regret despite an excellent, fully merited result that gives them real reason for optimism for the second leg at Anfield.
Karius and the woodwork kept them at bay and they had many other opportunities to produce a scoreline reflecting their superiority.
Southampton could have slammed the door on Liverpool - instead it remains ajar.
Karius has had to undergo a severe examination of his goalkeeping credentials and endure heavy public criticism in the early months of his Liverpool career.
Klopp placed great faith in the 23-year-old German, signed from his former club Mainz in a Â£4.75m deal this summer - eventually choosing him ahead of established first-choice Simon Mignolet.
The decision backfired and he was forced to drop Karius after two poor, error-strewn performances in the 4-3 loss at Bournemouth and the 2-2 home draw with West Ham.
Klopp has never lost belief, however, choosing Karius as his cup keeper - and he was rewarded here with an outstanding display, especially with two excellent saves from Redmond.
He is responsible for Liverpool still being in this tie after a shocking display.
Southampton manager Claude Puel:
""Liverpool had just the one chance all game. We were unlucky at the end because we know Liverpool away in the second leg will be very difficult.
""This competition is exciting, now it is important to keep the good concentration for the Premier League.
""We lost three games so it is important to have a good reaction.""
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp:
""We needed Loris Karius to save our lives two or three times.
""The best thing for us is the result. We know that we can play better at Anfield - nothing is decided.
""We cannot be happy with the performance, Southampton cannot be happy with the result. It could and should have been 2-0, 3-0.""
Former Leicester and Birmingham striker Steve Claridge:
You can make a strong case for Southampton winning 2-0 or even 3-0. Everyone here is happy but this is an opportunity missed.

14503479,"A review, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, also suggests these patients are less likely to respond to treatment.
Nearly one in 20 people in the UK has this form of depression as a result of childhood abuse, say researchers.
The charity Sane said the study highlighted how damaging childhood trauma could be.
Depression in some form can affect one in five people at some point in their lives. Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London were investigating depression which keeps on recurring.
They reviewed 16 studies, on a total of more than 23,000 patients, and found that maltreatment in childhood - such as rejection by the mother, harsh physical treatment or sexual abuse - more than doubled the risk of this type of depression.
One of the researchers, Dr Rudolf Uher, said: ""If these things happen early in life, it is more powerful.""
In the UK, 16% of people develop persistent depression by the age of 33. A quarter of them, or 4% of the whole UK population, were maltreated as a child.
In the study:
A separate review on 3,098 people showed childhood maltreatment was also linked to a poorer response to both drug and psychological treatment.
Lead researcher Dr Andrea Danese said: ""Even for combined treatments, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment cannot be adequately cared for.""
Their report suggests ""early preventive and therapeutic interventions may be more effective.""
There is no precise explanation of any link between abuse, changes in the body as a child and persistent depression 20 or more years later.
Childhood maltreatment, it is thought, causes changes to the brain, immune system and some hormone glands - some of which are still present in adulthood.
One possible mechanism is what is known as epigenetic changes to the DNA. While there is no change in the genetic code, the environment can alter the way genes are expressed.
Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: ""It may seem obvious that traumatic events in our lives can make us depressed, but this study highlights how particularly damaging such traumas can be when experienced during childhood, when our brains are still developing.
""We should all be concerned at how abuse and neglect creates a painful legacy that can last a lifetime, increasing our chances of experiencing repeated episodes of depression and reducing the effects of those treatments that are available to us.
""Yet we should not lose hope. Research such as this can point the way to better treatments and preventative measures.""","Childhood abuse doubles the risk of developing multiple and long-lasting episodes of depression, say scientists."

The firm also reported an impairment charge of A$384.5m.

TWE is the world's largest listed winemaker and owns brands such as Wolf Blass, Rosemount and Lindeman's.

The company said sales in China were hit by the government's austerity measures. But that was offset by ""continued strong volume growth in Hong Kong and increasing momentum in South East Asia.""
In a statement released with the earnings, the company acknowledged it went through a challenging year. And it said it plans to improve on its performance by boosting its marketing operations in growth markets, notably the US and Asia.
For the current financial year ending June 2015, chief executive Michael Clarke said: ""Investing in our sales and marketing capabilities is an important step.
""Crucially it will also facilitate a deeper understanding of our customers and underpin more collaborative and sustainable relationships across all our regions.""

The motion was defeated by the House of Clergy, following hours of debate.
The House of Bishops voted overwhelmingly (43-1) in favour of the report, and the House of Laity backed it by 106 votes to 83.

He added: ""The current report is not the end of the story. We will - as the bishops - think again and go on thinking. We will seek to do better.
""It was right that this needs to be about love joy and celebration of our humanity, of our belonging to Christ, all of us without exception, without exclusion.""
By Martin Bashir, BBC religious affairs correspondent
There is no easy way to dress up what has been an embarrassing night for the senior leadership of the Church of England.
After three years of so-called shared conversations costing the church more than ÃÂ£300,000, General Synod has chosen not to take note of the Bishops report.
It was neither the Bishops nor ordinary members of the church (the laity) who chose to reject the report. It was the vicars, rectors and priests that decided they could not continue with the current prohibition on blessing or marrying same sex couples in church.
For lesbian and gay Christians, there is widespread rejoicing. But conservative evangelicals are dismayed, the vote confirming what they say is their worst fear that the authority Scripture is no longer the rule of faith and practice.
The Bishops had said that the report was not the ""final word"" but rather a stepping stone toward greater inclusiveness.
But General Synod's decision not to ""take note"" means that it can no longer play any part in future discussions. The slate is wiped clean; who gets to write the next chapter is at this stage unclear.
Opening the debate, the Bishop of Norwich, Graham James,  said he regretted ""any pain or anger"" the report may have caused.
The Bishop of Willesden, the Right Reverend Pete Broadbent, apologised to members who felt alienated by the report.
""I do want to apologise to those members of Synod who found our report difficult, who didn't recognise themselves in it, who had expected more from us than we actually delivered, for the tone of the report,"" he said.
""On behalf of the House, and without being trite or trivial, I'm sorry.""
Before the debate, protesters gathered outside the Church of England headquarters and champions of LGBT rights sang hymns.
The group, organised by the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement and Changing Attitude now known collectively as One Body One Faith, with the support of Out and Proud African LGBTI and rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, called for the rejection of the bishops' report.
Mr Tatchell said the Synod's vote was a ""victory for love and equality"".
The Reverend Bertrand Olivier, who's gay, told the BBC the Church needed to reflect modern society.
He said: ""I was ordained as an openly gay candidate then and it's been going backwards ever since at the same time as the nation has moved on and we now have legal same-sex marriage.""
But the Right Reverend Pete Broadbent had said campaigners may be asking too much.
He said: ""Our role is to hold the Church together and say we can only go as far as the whole church can agree. Campaigners are actually wanting us to go further, more hurriedly, than we necessarily can.""
The Synod earlier unanimously passed a motion urging the government to bring forward proposals to reduce the amount gamblers can stake on on fixed-odds betting terminals from ÃÂ£100 to ÃÂ£2.

37049439,"Peter Lewis of Llanelli was discharged from Cardiff's private Spire Hospital in December 2010, but his condition deteriorated and he died in January 2011 at Prince Philip Hospital.
Private hospitals do not fall within the Public Services Ombudsman's remit.
But it is hoped a draft bill will close this perceived loophole.
Private clinics and hospitals only fall within ombudsman Nick Bennett's remit if treatment provided there has been commissioned and funded by the NHS.
But a potential law could enable him to investigate cases where a patient has received a combination of NHS and private healthcare - even where that has been paid for by the patient themselves.
Former rugby player Mr Lewis, 83, was admitted to Spire Hospital for knee replacement surgery.
He was also suffering from kidney failure and other complicating illnesses.
He was discharged shortly before Christmas, but Mr Lewis died at Prince Philip from hospital-acquired pneumonia the following month.
His widow, Ruth Lewis, felt he had been discharged from Spire too soon and not given the appropriate care and monitoring while in the hospital.
She claimed her husband was ""denied a fighting chance"" to recover from surgery.
Spire said providing high-quality patient care was its ""utmost priority"" and was taken ""very seriously"".
Mrs Lewis first asked for independent adjudication in June 2014, after feeling earlier inquiries into her complaints by Spire had not been rigorous enough.
But the investigation by Sally Williams did not begin until more than a year later, in September 2015.
In her report, submitted to Mrs Lewis and Spire in June 2016, Ms Williams upheld two of Mrs Lewis' complaints in full and one partially.
She said aspects of the care at Spire ""represent a serious departure from the standard to be reasonably expected"", concluding Mr Lewis should have received a blood transfusion prior to surgery and not to have done so amounted to ""a significant failure in delivery of care"".
It was a ""failure of good practice"" not to repeat certain tests before Mr Lewis' discharge from hospital.
But the report did not find negligence in the care provided.
Spire was ordered to make a ""goodwill payment"" of ÃÂ£2,250 to Mrs Lewis.
Mrs Lewis said: ""It's been very frustrating and I've had to use all my emotion and resources to keep these complaints alive, but it was something I had to do because I knew things were not as they should have been.
""I would never have found peace if I hadn't reached this point.""
Mrs Lewis said she was ""delighted"" that her case was being used to push for new powers.
""That's the only fair way a case such as Peter's that dovetailed between national health and private care can be looked at fairly and thoroughly,"" she added.
Mr Bennett said Mr Lewis' case proved there was a ""gap"" in the system and said he was favour of the draft legislation that would give him more power to investigate such cases.
""It would be a huge shame if we don't use that legislation and put it on the statue book.
""We could do it within the space of three months, so that we can really improve public services. And make sure that my powers are there, not for me, but for the people of Wales.""
If the new legislation is enacted it will be the first of its kind for the assembly in its 17-year history - a committee-sponsored bill leading to legislative change.
Sarah Lloyd-Davies, director of Spire, said: ""We acknowledge that it's been a difficult five and a half years for Mrs Lewis, her family and also for the medical staff who treated Mr Lewis.
""We hope that the adjudicator's outcome will provide closure for all concerned.""
She added the hospital would write to Mrs Lewis to outline how it intended to address the recommendations from the independent adjudication.
Sally Taber, director of the Independent Sector Complaints Adjudication Service, said: ""ISCAS has learned from the lessons of his adjudication and will pass them onto all its member hospitals.""

His immune system was down after nine or 10 surgeries and his calf was so swollen it had to be cut to relieve the pressure.
""They had to make a quick decision,"" said Cunningham. ""Was my heart strong enough to fight off the infection or did they need to amputate the leg?
""I decided it was life or limb for me and I decided since I can still live with one leg, I might as well take that route.""
On Christmas Eve 2016 he had his left leg amputated below the knee.
""I was just thinking about living. I haven't done a lot of things in my life that I really wanted to accomplish before my time was up. I decided I could still do that stuff with one leg - I would trade that for my leg.""
Doctors still do not know what caused Cunningham's heart to go into ventricular fibrillation. He is being monitored, but the organ looks ""young and healthy"" and he says medics are not certain they will ever know the answer.
Cunningham is pretty matter of fact about a decision that ended his career so prematurely. It was a promising career that had seen him drafted into the NHL by the Boston Bruins in 2010 and play 63 NHL games for them and the Coyotes.
""I accepted it right away,"" he said. ""I had to make decisions that I would not play again, and I decided in the hospital bed 'you're only 26, you have a lot of life to live, you can't keep focusing on why did this happen?'
""It did happen, it is lucky I pulled through and now I have to move forward and find something else.""
His playing days over, Cunningham was offered a number of jobs and has accepted one as a scout at the Coyotes.
""It's a huge shock to your life,"" he added. ""The difference when you retire is that you make the decision that your career is over.
""For me my career came to a sudden halt - I didn't have the decision to make on it. The first two or three months were tough. I looked at myself in the mirror and said 'what now?'
""This has been my whole life, everything I have focused on.""
Four months after he collapsed, Cunningham stepped back on the ice - this time wearing a prosthetic leg.
""Mentally it was another step in my recovery,"" he said.
""My expectations were not high at the start. I had just started to walk when I went back on the ice - I knew it would not be awesome. But for me mentally, and my team-mates, it was important for people to see me back on the ice.
""I wanted to set an example that you may have been dealt a bad card, that this not the way you hoped life would go, that it throws you curveballs, but you have to step up and accept what comes at you, move forward and push along as well as you can.""
He has a number of different feet for the different tasks required for his prosthetic leg - and says the hardest challenge is getting used to the lack of ankle control needed for skating. But Cunningham hopes he can inspire others with his resolve.
He added: ""When I first had the amputation I didn't know if I would walk again, let alone skate. For me I look on social media and see these amputee athletes running and competing in the Paralympics and that pushes me along and makes me want to get out there and get better.
""Maybe people seeing me getting back on the ice, it will helps others.""
""The mental side of it is sometimes the hardest part. The doctor tells me I need to slow down and take a step back and realise what is going on - it's been only a couple of months.
""I have had always had a personality that I want to push forward and push things to the limit as hard as I can. Every day I want to push my body to the limits it has now - which are different than before - pushing to try and get back to normality as much as I can.""","""Growing up in Canada, ice hockey is like football in England - every kid dreams of making it,"" says former NHL player Craig Cunningham."

39855288,"As a journalist, there are some stories which simply never leave you. Strangely, it is rarely the story itself which leaves its mark. It is the people you meet along the way.
For me, it was a young Romanian man.
I never learned his name. I had travelled with him for three days across seven countries on a bus, in search of work.
We ate together and I laughed with him and watched him cry yet I never learned his name.
I had been investigating human trafficking and the supply chain between Eastern Europe and Scotland.
Romanian traffickers, I heard, were bringing victims over to the UK in such large numbers that they were now using every route possible to fulfil demand.
I was told a bus now ran three times a week from Bucharest to Glasgow.
A bus which traffickers had used to bring their victims over.
I heard the bus was full every week, nearly all those on board coming to the UK for work.
All willingly, it is just some may later discover they had been trafficked.
If I wanted to understand the stories behind the people coming to the UK - by choice or otherwise - I knew I would have to get that bus, earn the trust of those on board and hope they would tell me what I wanted to know.
I knew it would be too dangerous to film openly as traffickers had used the route to bring their ""merchandise"" over, sometimes travelling with their victims to ensure their safe arrival.
So, armed with a small camcorder and a couple of covert ones, I headed to Bucharest.
The following morning I was taken by taxi to a car park on the outskirts of the city.
A minibus would pick me up from there, I was told, take me to the other side of Romania, where I would meet a long-distance coach which would take me to my destination.
The minibus driver wanted Â£165 from me for a one-way ticket to Glasgow. He insisted on being paid in pounds Sterling and told me they did this route three times a week.
I climbed inside the Transit van.
There were no windows in the back where I had to sit.
The handles had been removed from the inside of the doors, the driver told me it was because people kept trying to get out as it was travelling.
The next 10 hours were spent crossing Romania, stopping only to pick up people or parcels.
I witnessed hundreds of pounds being passed over. Everyone I spoke to was taking this route for the first time.
The men were going to work in factories or vegetable fields, car washes or construction.
The women to work in hotels or care homes. Some to visit their husbands.
Eventually we arrived in Cluj on the east of the country where we were to board the coach which was to be our home for the next three days.
Waiting on its arrival was the first time I was able to speak with my fellow passengers.
The first group I spoke to were going to Leeds, Luton, Southampton and London.
Two were going to work in construction, one in a warehouse. The others in factories.
A man who was going to work in a car wash told me he would be working six or seven days a week, 11 hours a shift. For that he would be paid Â£40 per day.
He said: ""It's very small eh? For a Romanian it is a very hard life here.
""You work for Â£7 per day. It is a hard life. Romania, Poland, Czech Republic, this is the problem, we work too much. But you have to understand life in Romania. In Romania you work for Â£7 per day.
""You have family, you have kids, so Â£7 is nothing. It's a very hard life.""
A construction worker told me he too would be working six days a week, 10 hours a day. For that, he would get Â£200.
Others would be getting Â£3.50 an hour for vegetable picking.
Most were told that accommodation would be provided by the people who were offering the work.
They didn't know how many others they would be sharing with, although one man told me he suspected it would be many, as that was what had happened to others he knew who had come here before.
The bus arrived shortly before 10 that evening. It was already filled with passengers as I got on board.
I found an empty seat, it was cramped and uncomfortable.
There was a toilet we weren't allowed to use. There were two drivers who rotated shifts so that the bus could drive through the coming days and nights.
Loud music was played almost non-stop for the entire journey.
Surprisingly there was an on-board entertainment system - a screen at the front of the bus.
Even more surprisingly was the movie being played - Liam Neeson's ""Taken"", a film about human trafficking, albeit played mute with Romanian subtitles.
The first night was hard. There was a bad smash in front of the bus as we crossed through Hungary. One dead, others badly injured. I watched the body being covered with a blanket.
It was only when we stopped a few hours later that I was able to speak to other passengers.
One man was going to work in a factory.
He didn't know what his wage would be but said he had been to the UK before and paid a pittance.
He was only returning because any money earned in the UK would be more than what he would get back home in Romania.
""Do you feel exploited?"" I asked him.
""Yes, every day, yeah,"" he said.
The next passenger I spoke to was just 19.  It was his first time away from home and he needed to work so he could send money back to his family.
He looked frightened and I asked if he was nervous. ""A little"", he told me.
He had been offered a job as a waiter near Crawley.
For a six-day week, 10 hours a day, he would be paid Â£118. For the week.
He would be put in a flat with others. He didn't know how many.
His English was almost perfect.
He told me: ""In Romania I work in IT and now I am going to be a waiter. It's kind of a big deal. I have no experience.""
He told me he had a cousin in the UK. I asked if he would be able to go to her for help if he needed.
""No"", he said, ""My family is broken and so I have no-one here.""
We travelled onwards, through Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France.
Each time we stopped, the young waiter would come and find me, talk to me about his life back home, his fear of being in the UK alone, and his sheer desperation at the situation he now found himself in.
He warned me when some of the men in the bus, bored with hassling each other, had started to target me sexually.
He would walk me to the toilets at the service stations so I wasn't alone. He told me about his family and became upset as the tiredness and reality of what he was doing began to take its toll.
Finally, in the early hours of the third day, we crossed the Channel and were driven to a service station on the outskirts of London.
It was five in the morning and a number of minibuses were waiting for us all.
Like cattle, we were herded into different groups and told to get in the minibuses.
I went and sought out the young waiter in the darkness, to say goodbye. But he had already boarded his minibus and I watched it pull out of the service station and drive off into the night.
I got into the minibus bound for Scotland.
As we headed north, I wondered which of my travelling companions - already clearly being exploited in the UK - would find out they've been trafficked.
I hoped the young waiter wouldn't be one of them.

The latest moves add to a flurry of suspensions this week as fund managers seek to prevent a stampede to the exit following the vote to leave the EU.
Investors are worried that a move to leave the European Union will send commercial property prices tumbling.
L&G has cut its ÃÂ£2.3bn ($2.99bn) UK property fund by a further 10%, following a previous 5% valuation cut.
Including Aberdeen, at least seven property funds have suspended trading following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
Aberdeen Asset Management extended a suspension of its fund to 11 July on Thursday after announcing a 17% cut to its value.
It initially said on Wednesday it would pause the fund for 24 hours.
Henderson, Canada Life and Threadneedle became the latest on Wednesday to close their doors to traders looking to sell.
That followed similar moves by M&G, Aviva and Standard Life, which have all restricted access to their funds this week.
The large number of investors trying to sell their holdings in the funds is putting pressure on the fund managers to sell properties they own at sharp discounts, said the manager of one suspended fund.
""Sellers requiring liquidity are having to market properties at sometimes significant discounts to their recent valuations,"" said Martin Gilbert, chief executive at Aberdeen Asset Management.
The vote to leave the EU has led investors to worry that there may be significant falls in commercial property, while the impact on house prices is also being closely watched.
""At this time, it is still difficult to predict the exact impact of the vote to leave and subsequent market events on commercial property values,"" Legal & General Investment Management said in a statement.",Confidence in the UK property sector took a further pounding on Thursday after Legal & General made a deeper cut in the value of its property fund.
30524803,"Christine Connor and co-accused Stuart Downes are both facing trial on charges linked to the Belfast attack last year.
Ms Connor is charged with attempted murder after pipe bombs were thrown at a police car in May 2013, leaving at least one officer shaken but unhurt.
Mr Downes, of Ryton Close, Shrewsbury, is charged with aiding and abetting.
Ms Connor is also accused of possessing improvised explosives with intent to endanger life, causing an explosion likely to endanger life, and preparation of a terrorist act.
The 29-year-old defendant lives in north Belfast, but her full address cannot be disclosed due to reporting restrictions.
Following a preliminary inquiry hearing at Belfast Magistrates' Court, a judge ruled that both defendants have a case to answer over the pipe bomb attack in Ballysillan.
Mr Downes, 30, was returned for Crown Court trial on continuing bail while Ms Connor was ordered to remain in custody.
She has now spent more than a year and a half in custody ahead of her trial, and her defence team returned to court on Wednesday to ask that she also be released on bail.
However, prosecutors claimed Ms Connor has strong dissident republican links and recruited a man with no previous known allegiances to take part in the alleged murder plot.
When she was originally charged, Ms Connor had refused to stand in the dock as the offences were put to her.
Prosecution counsel set out how her release was blocked earlier this year because she objected to wearing an electronic tag.
During the renewed bail application, the court heard claims Ms Connor could commit further offences.
The prosecutor said: ""There's a number of Facebook conversations with this applicant saying she is at war with the police.""
He added: ""She recruited another person, Mr Downes, a person with no previous terrorist links or even republican sympathies, to become involved in this case.""
The prosecution also revealed that detectives fear her co-accused could be at risk.
""There was a bullet posted to him one month ago. That was intercepted by police,"" the lawyer said.
""That appears to be a veiled threat to Mr Downes.""
However, Ms Connor's defence barrister said it was the first time any bullet had been mentioned.
He accepted his client had previously refused to wear a tag, claiming she had felt the condition to have been unfairly imposed on her alone.
When the barrister pointed out Ms Connor has already spent more than a year and a half in custody, the judge questioned whether the accused would comply with release terms.
He said: ""What confidence can I have in somebody who could not even stand when asked by the court clerk?""
Refusing bail, the judge ruled that nothing had changed since her earlier objection to being electronically monitored.","A woman accused of trying to kill a police officer in a pipe bomb attack declared herself ""at war with the police"" on Facebook, a court has heard."

Mr Putin and Mr Trump had agreed to stay in touch by phone and arrange to meet in person at a later date, the Kremlin added.
The Kremlin did not make it clear who had initiated the phone call.
But Mr Trump's office said the Kremlin had called and that issues such as mutual threats and challenges, and strategic economic affairs, were discussed.
It said: ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.""
Mr Trump's election has seen a change in tone from Russia towards the US, with state TV channels quickly switching from claims of electoral fraud to hailing the triumph of the ""man of the people"".
The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says that Russia views America's new president as a pragmatist - a brash businessman that Russians can do business with.
Relations between the two countries have soured in recent years, despite President Obama starting his eight years in office by calling for a ""reset"" with one of the US' long-term rivals.
While Russia and the US have managed to work together on issues like North Korea and Iran, they have openly clashed on Syria.
Mr Obama has also condemned Russia's intervention on the side of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, while Russia's decision to grant whistleblower Edward Snowden asylum infuriated Washington.
Mr Trump's rival for the presidency was no better liked in Moscow. Hillary Clinton was sharply critical of Russia's 2011 parliamentary elections, leading President Putin to accuse her of fomenting the mass protests against him that followed.
Mr Obama met Mr Trump last week and, at a press conference on Monday, said the new president had ""expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships"", including ""strong and robust Nato"" partnerships.
During the election campaign, Mr Trump had openly criticised those Nato members who he believed were not doing enough work within the organisation and had relied too heavily on the US.
Mr Obama was speaking ahead of a trip that takes in Germany, Greece and Peru.
He said he hoped Mr Trump would ""look at the facts"" of the nuclear deal agreed with Iran, an accord the president-elect has to this point resolutely opposed.
Mr Obama said he ""absolutely"" still had concerns about a Trump presidency and that there would be ""certain elements of [Mr Trump's] temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognises them"".
But he said there was ""enormous continuity"" in the US presidency and he believed the US would remain a ""pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe"".
Mr Trump will succeed Mr Obama in the White House on 20 January.

Club: Swindon Town
Population: Approximately 180,000
Average attendance in Premier League season: 15,274
Journey: Swindon Town's 4-3 Wembley win over Leicester in 1993 will go down as one of the most thrilling play-off finals, and marked the Robins' rise from the bottom.
The 1986 Fourth Division champions lost manager Lou Macari to West Ham in 1989. Former Tottenham midfielder Ossie Ardiles came in and, in his first season, they won promotion to the top flight as Second Division play-off winners, but there was a twist in the tale...
They were initially demoted to the Third Division for irregular payments, but partially won an appeal meaning they stayed in the second tier. Under the management of Glenn Hoddle, top-flight football was brought to the County Ground for the first time via the play-offs in 1993.
Outcome: Bournemouth fans will get little confidence from this - it was to be the club's only season in the top flight. With John Gorman replacing Hoddle, they won only five league matches and conceded a record 100 goals. They have since suffered financial problems and became the first former Premier League club to be relegated to the Football League's bottom division in 2006.
They said: ""Coming back on the bus after Wembley, down the M4, the bridges were draped in flags, towels, anything that was red and white. You can never tire of remembering those days, they were wonderful times."" - Former Swindon defender Paul Bodin
Club: Burnley
Population: Circa 81,000
Average attendance in Premier League this season: 19,133
Journey: Wade Elliott ensured himself legendary status in the claret half of east Lancashire when his 20-yard screamer won Burnley the 2009 play-off final against Sheffield United to end their 33-year top-flight exile.
Burnley spent most of their early history in England's top two divisions, but remained outside the top flight from 1976 to 2009. In 1987 - during a seven-year spell in the lowest tier of the Football League - they narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference.
Despite one of the lower budgets in the Championship, Burnley have won promotion twice to the Premier League in the last six years.
Outcome: They were unable to avoid immediate relegation in 2010, going down with two games to spare. They surprised many by returning to the top flight in 2014, this time under boss Sean Dyche. Top scorer Charlie Austin had been sold to QPR and Dyche had to work on a tight budget, heavily relying on free transfers and the loan market. They are currently bottom of the table and five points adrift of safety.
They said: ""We had 36,000 supporters at Wembley, which is about half our population. When Manchester United play at home there are more people at Old Trafford than in the whole town of Burnley."" - Ex-Burnley boss Owen Coyle in 2009
Club: Wigan
Population: Less than 90,000
Average attendance in their last season in Premier League in 2013: 19,375
Journey: Wigan Athletic did not come into existence until 1932, making them the youngest club to be promoted to the Premier League. They only joined the Football League in 1978. It began well enough but, in 1994, they finished fourth from bottom in the lowest tier and average crowds had dropped below 2,000.
The turning point came in 1995 when local businessman Dave Whelan, a self-made millionaire through his sportswear business, bought the club and immediately targeted the Premier League. The Latics, who moved to the JJB (now DW) Stadium, achieved that aim on the final day of the 2004-05 season with a 3-1 win over Reading.
Outcome: This is more like it, Cherries. Wigan took to Premier League life easily and spent much of their season challenging for European football as well as reaching the League Cup final. They stayed in the top flight for eight seasons, until relegation to the Championship in 2013, days after winning the FA Cup. The Latics are now on the verge of dropping into League One.
They said: ""Any professional football club could have the dream of playing in the Premier League and winning a major trophy and Dave Whelan showed the way to do that. It is a great football story and I am sure it will inspire many generations to come."" - Former Wigan boss Roberto Martinez
Club: Blackburn Rovers
Population: Circa 120,000
Average attendance in last season in Premier League in 2012: 22,500
Journey: Blackburn were far from top-flight novices prior to their promotion in 1992, winning the First Division in both 1912 and 1914 and enjoying spells in the top tier in the middle of the century. But, from 1966, the mill town experienced a 26-year exile from the elite.
A defeat in the 1989-90 Second Division play-off semi-finals was followed by the takeover of local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter Jack Walker, which started Rovers' transformation into Premier League champions. They appointed Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish as manager and, in his first season, he took the club into the Premier League via a play-off win over Leicester.
Outcome: This will take some beating. Rovers finished fourth and second in their first two seasons in the top flight. They then made history by becoming the only town club ever to win the Premier League when they lifted the trophy on the final day of the season at Anfield.
Barring one season back in the Championship, they spent 20 years in the top flight, playing in the Champions League and winning a League Cup. However they were relegated in 2012 and are now ninth in the second tier.
They said: ""No club our size will ever win the Premier League again. We had a bit of money but it was more to do with spirit, attitude and Kenny's ability to sign the right players. Local businessmen like Jack Walker couldn't compete with the money we are talking about these days.""  - Former Blackburn Rovers striker Kevin Gallacher.
Club: Barnsley
Population: Just more than 90,000
Average attendance in Premier League season: 18,433
Journey: After 109 years, the Tykes gained entry to English football's elite division for the first time in 1997 with a 2-0 win over Bradford in the penultimate game of the season.
Because of their yellow away shirts, the Oakwell crowd were often known to sing ""it's just like watching Brazil"" in the stands as manager Danny Wilson secured his place in club folklore, building a team who played stylish, attacking football.
Outcome: Bournemouth fans look away now. Barnsley were immediately relegated after finishing 19th in the Premiership, five points adrift of safety. They entered administration in 2002 and were relegated from the Championship last season.
They said: ""We've done it the right way, working hard and honestly and playing good football. These fans have seen a lot of hard times here, they deserve this."" - Barnsley boss Danny Wilson
Club: Blackpool

Average attendance in last Premier League season: 15,780
Journey: Blackpool won the 2010 play-off final over Cardiff to clinch a top-flight place for the first time since 1971.
Achieved on the lowest wage bill in the Championship, it was witnessed by one of the smallest average attendances in the division and masterminded at a dilapidated training ground still in use since the days of the legendary Stanley Matthews.
Outcome: The Tangerines were relegated on the final day of the season, despite attacking performances that brought them much praise.
They almost won promotion again the next season but, since then, have had five managers, been relegated to League One for next season after only four league wins, and fans are protesting against owner Owen Oyston and son Karl.

30980321,"The country's economic crisis was caused in large part because its government had taken on excessive debts.
So at the time the crisis began in earnest, at the end of 2009, its debts as a share of GDP were 127% of GDP or national income - and rose the following year to 146% of GDP.
As a condition of the official rescues, significant public spending cuts and austerity were imposed on Greece. And that had quite an impact on economic activity.
The country was already in recession following the 2008 financial crisis. But since 2010, and thanks in large part to austerity imposed by Brussels, GDP has shrunk a further 19%.
GDP per head, perhaps a better measure of the hardship imposed on Greeks, has fallen 22% since the onset of the 2008 debacle.
So austerity has certainly hurt. But has it worked to get Greece's debts down?
To the contrary, Greek debt as a share of GDP has soared to 176% of GDP, as of the end of September 2014.
Now it has fallen a bit in absolute terms. Greek public sector debt was 265bn euros in 2008, 330bn euros in 2010 and was 316bn in September of last year.
But it is debt as a share of GDP or national income which determines affordability. And on that important measure, Greece's debt problem is worse today than it was when it was rescued.
To state the obvious, it is the collapse in the economy which has done the damage. And although Greece started to grow again last year, at the current annual growth rate of 1.6% (which may not be sustained) it would take longer than a generation to reduce national debt to a manageable level.
Little wonder therefore that a party - Syriza - campaigning to end austerity and write off debts, has enjoyed an overwhelming victory in the general election.
That it appears to be two seats short of a clear majority in the Athens parliament should not disguise the clear message sent by Greek people to Brussels.
Or perhaps it would be more apt to talk of the message being sent to Berlin - since it is Germany which has been the big eurozone country most wedded to the economic orthodoxy that there's no gain without austerity pain.
As for investors. there are two reasons why Syriza's victory is significant.
First, and as I've mentioned, its leader Alexis Tsipras has a clear mandate to negotiate an easing of austerity imposed by Brussels and the IMF, and a write-off of at least some of the country's massive public sector debts.
At the moment, he and his colleagues are stressing that they want to negotiate and are sending out emollient signals. But the Germans are saying that the deal done with Greece in the rescue is the deal that holds.
So compromise may prove impossible - Greece rudely ripped from or bolting from the eurozone is not an impossibility,
The second reason the victory is significant is that younger anti-austerity parties are on the march all over Europe, and are doing especially well in France and Spain.
If Syriza were to win its negotiations with the rest of the eurozone these other anti-austerity parties would look more credible to voters. The victory of protectionist, nationalising Marine le Pen in France's presidential election would be an interesting test of markets' sangfroid (ahem).
And if Syriza were to lose in talks with Brussels and Berlin, and the final rupture of Greece from the euro were to take place, investors might well pull their savings from any eurozone country where nationalists are in the ascendant.
So why aren't investors in a state of frenzied panic? Why have the euro and stock markets bounced a bit this morning? One slightly implausible explanation is that investors believe the eurozone would actually be stronger without Greece, so long as no other big country followed it out the door.
More likely is that they believe reason will prevail, and Berlin will sanction a write-off of Greece's excessive debts.
Here is the important point: outside of Germany it is almost impossible to find an economist or central banker who believed that the previous reconstruction of Greek debt was ever going to work.
So just maybe, after Greeks have made a colossal and some would say pointless economic sacrifice, Germany will allow a rescue that permits the country a fighting chance of crawling out from beneath its colossal debts.",The Greek people don't seem desperately grateful for the 240bn euros in bailouts they've had from the eurozone and IMF - and here is one way of seeing why.
39075502,"The money from the Constitutional Research Council was spent on pro-Brexit advertising throughout the UK, said DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.
The CRC is chaired by Richard Cook, a former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.
Mr Donaldson said about Â£425,000 was spent on the Brexit campaign.
The DUP said they were given more money than they spent and the remainder of the donation, around Â£9,000 was transferred to the party's funds with the agreement of the Constitutional Research Council.
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Donaldson stressed it was ""not a Northern Ireland referendum, but a UK-wide referendum"".
The revelation came as the spending returns of the Stronger In and Vote Leave campaigns in last year's EU referendum are under investigation, the Electoral Commission has announced.
A total of more than Â£32m was spent on the campaign - with the Leave side funded by donations totalling Â£16.4m, outgunning the Remain side's Â£15.1m.
During the referendum campaign, the DUP took out a four-page ""Vote To Leave EU"" advertisement in the Metro newspaper - which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland.
Earlier this month, DUP leader Arlene Foster declined to reveal the identity of the donor or donors but said the money was properly accounted for ""under the rules as they currently stand"".
While political donations in Northern Ireland are kept confidential for fear of identifying donors, other parties had called on the DUP to clarify who funded its ""lavish"" pro-Brexit advertising campaign.
Mr Donaldson said his party had ""reached millions"" by spending the money on media outside of Northern Ireland.
He denied the DUP had broken the spirit of electoral law.
""Absolutely not, the DUP registered as a national campaign organisation for the referendum,"" he said.
""The law is very clear, the political parties and referendums act allows any political organisation to register nationally to participate in a campaign.
""We recognised that this referendum was going to be won or lost on a national basis. That's why we spent money advertising in the Metro free sheet because it would reach far more people.
""This way we reached millions of people and the feedback we got back from our campaign was very, very positive.""","The DUP has confirmed it received a Brexit donation of about Â£435,000 from a group of pro-union business people led by a Conservative party member."
18899708,"Holly Waters was pronounced dead on arrival at University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS) after a 22-mile (35km) journey by ambulance on 28 June.
She lived 2.5 miles (4km) from Stafford Hospital.
A hospital spokesman said the paediatric ward had been full and handling an emergency at the time.
Holly, who up until that point had been a normal, healthy baby, was found unconscious in her cot by her mother, Charlotte Waters.
The family called 999 and a paramedic arrived four minutes later at 22:46 BST.
It was at 23:37 BST that the baby reached the Stoke-on-Trent hospital.
Stafford Hospital's A&E has been shut from 22:00 to 08:00 since December, as Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust needs to recruit additional staff.
Holly's father Sean Birch said this - and an already full children's ward - had led to up to a 20-minute delay.
Mr Birch said: ""We were actually told that she died two minutes away from North Staffordshire, but if she had gone to Stafford Hospital and they had managed to put a drip in and stabilise her, then send her to North Staffordshire, she would still be here today.""
Both West Midlands Ambulance Service and the Mid Staffordshire trust said it was impossible to say whether admitting Holly to Stafford Hospital would have made a difference.
According to the ambulance service, both the officer at the scene and ambulance control contacted Stafford's A&E department but were told the unit could not accept Holly.
Requests to take the baby to the children's ward at Stafford were also refused, the ambulance service said.
Colin Ovington, director of nursing and midwifery at Stafford Hospital, claimed it would have been unsafe for the paediatric unit to have accepted Holly.
""The staff were already treating a very seriously ill child who had been brought in as an emergency and they were also caring for a number of other emergency admissions and sick children,"" he said.
""The staff correctly followed the joint protocol between the hospital and West Midlands Ambulance Service for these circumstances.""
In a statement, Mid Staffordshire trust said: ""When contacted by the West Midlands ambulance crew, our paediatric ward told the crew that they were unable to accept the baby because they did not have the capacity in the ward and were already dealing with an emergency.
""As per the agreed protocol, the ambulance crew were directed to take the baby to UHNS.
""The ambulance crew also contacted our A&E department, who repeated the instruction that the baby should be taken to UHNS.
""Following an internal investigation, this was not reported as a serious incident.
""There was no reason to discipline or suspend any member of staff.""
A spokeswoman for NHS Midlands and East, the strategic health authority, said it had not been informed about the incident.
""It is disappointing that this incident was not formally reported and we are now seeking assurances from the NHS organisations that this is being investigated, in order to fully understand what took place,"" she said.
An initial post-mortem examination was unable to find the cause of death.
An inquest will be held in due course.",A seven-month old baby died after being refused access to Stafford Hospital because its A&E department is shut at night and the children's ward was full.
30289946,"The pair were picked up by military intelligence after entering Lebanon with forged papers 10 days ago.
Baghdadi's wife - identified as an Iraqi national - is being questioned at the defence ministry.
In June, Baghdadi was named the leader of the ""caliphate"" created by IS in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls.
Last month the group denied reports that he had been killed or injured in an air strike by US-led forces near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
Describing them as ""a valuable catch"", the Lebanese newspaper al-Safir said that the IS leader's wife and child had been detained in co-ordination with ""foreign intelligence services"".
They were held at a border crossing near the north-eastern town of Arsal while trying to enter Lebanon.
They were currently being held for interrogation at the defence ministry's headquarters in al-Yarza, in the hills overlooking Beirut, it added.
There were conflicting reports about the child, with a senior Lebanese security official telling Reuters news agency it was a girl - a direct contradiction of most news reports.
A DNA test is being carried out to confirm the child is Baghdadi's.
Lebanese officials initially said the woman was Syrian, but later identified her as an Iraqi called Saja al-Dulaimi, who had been living in Syria.
A woman with that name was detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Qaeda's local affiliate, al-Nusra Front.
The exchange saw Islamic State's rival hand over a group of abducted Greek Orthodox nuns in return for the release of 150 of the Syrian government's female prisoners.
Assuming the reports are true - and there is little reason to doubt them - the Lebanese authorities now face the delicate question of what to do with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife and offspring.
In theory, they could prove a useful bargaining chip in the highly-charged imbroglio surrounding the fate of more than 20 Lebanese Army soldiers held hostage since August by IS and the rival al-Qaeda-linked militant group, al-Nusra Front.
The militants are demanding the release of Islamist prisoners in Lebanese jails to spare the soldiers' lives - three have already been murdered.
But al-Nusra has been much more involved than IS in back-channel negotiations for a possible exchange, so there is no guarantee it would pay off.
And there is always the possibility that the continued detention of the pair could provoke IS to seek revenge in one way or another, perhaps by seizing more hostages.
A US government source told Reuters that it was not sure how recently the woman had been with Baghdadi, and how much information, if any, she might have.
However, a Lebanese official said the arrest was a ""powerful card to apply pressure"" in the hostage negotiations with IS and al-Nusra.
Very little is known about Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has not been seen in public since being filmed delivering a sermon at a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July.
A profile published by IS supporters that month said the Iraqi was married, but it is unclear how many wives he has.
Tribal sources in Iraq told Reuters he had three wives - two Iraqis and one Syrian. Under Islamic law he is allowed up to four.
The US has offered a $10m (ÃÂ£6.4m) reward for information leading to the capture or killing of Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai.
After rumours of his death emerged last month, IS released an audio recording purportedly of Baghdadi in which he claimed that the caliphate was expanding and called for ""volcanoes of jihad"" to erupt the world over.","Lebanese security forces have detained a wife and young child of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi near the border with Syria, the army says."
33114120,"These days he even teaches Japanese students how to make the national delicacy and more than 2,500 would-be cooks have passed through his culinary training course.
Such is his reputation that last year he was even chosen to be among a group of chefs representing Japan's National Association of Sushi in the ""World Cup of Sushi"".
""Japan helped to realise my dream,"" says Mr Juneck. ""Today I have a son in college and have won recognition in the area where I have invested all my life's effort.""
Mr Juneck is part of a vibrant two-way cultural connection between Brazil and Japan.
Starting in 1908, hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens left behind a then troubled economy to start a new life in South America's largest country.
With a strong work ethic and a country rich in natural resources, many made successful lives there. Contrary to their own expectations, many stayed on in Brazil, raising children and grandchildren.
Brazil now has the largest Japanese-descendant population in the world outside of Japan, and it is at its most visible in the famous Liberdade district of Sao Paulo, with its red painted archways and Japanese restaurants.
But when Brazil's economy hit troubled times in the 1980s, this process went into reverse and descendants of Japanese immigrants began to look to Japan, the country of their parents or grandparents, as a land of opportunity.
Initially some went with tourist visas, but in 1990 Japanese law was changed to allow descendants of Japanese citizens long-stay visas and the right to work.
In 2008, at the peak of this influx, there were some 320,000 Brazilians of Japanese descent living and working in Japan - a number that has now dropped to around 170,000.
So strong was the South American presence that traditional Brazilian barbecue restaurants known as churrascarias began to appear in Japan.
Such was the concentration of Brazilians in Oizumi, 100km to the north of Tokyo, that it turned into a tourist attraction, becoming known as Japan's ""Brazilian town"".
Some 10% of the population of just over 40,000 is said to be Brazilian - and busloads of curious Japanese tourists come to get a little taste of South American life.
""They are Japanese of all ages,"" says Shuichi Ono, from the local tourist association. ""The older ones want to try the food, those who are younger take lessons in samba and capoeira [a martial arts dance].""
The Brazilians are known in Japan as ""dekassegui"", or literally ""people who leave home to work in another place"".
And Mr Juneck is not the only Brazilian to teach the Japanese one of their national skills.
Kamila Miyuki Yamashiro, 24, gives lessons at Hakubi Kyoto, one of Japan's most famous schools dedicated to the art of wearing the traditional Kimono.
""I always wore the Kimono in Brazil, but didn't know a lot about it,"" says Ms Yamashiro, who has now been in Japan seven years and is also a professional singer of Japanese Enka music.
Wearing the Kimono is not as easy as it seems and it took her four years to get the qualification that allows her to teach.
""At the start of this year, I became the youngest teacher in Hakubi,"" she says proudly.
Some Brazilians of Japanese descent have found it harder to adjust to life in Japan.
""Japan left me a long way from family and friends,"" says freelance photographer Patricia Rodrigues Shibata, who arrived in 1991 but struggled to adapt. ""I was very lonely.""
More recent problems in the country, such as the impact of the economic crisis, have prompted many Brazilians to head back home. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami gave added impetus to this process.
Some, however, have stuck it out.
Sueli Guishi, 52, has been in Japan for 22 years and has overcame many challenges, not least ill health and losing a kidney to diabetes. She has now embarked upon an entirely new career as a singer.
""Everyone has problems, but I have learned that the best place in the world is where you live well. Where else could I have started a career as a singer aged 47?""
With such optimism, the strong links between Brazil and Japan are likely to continue for some time to come.",Ricardo Juneck enjoys a rare honour among foreigners living in Japan - the 46-year-old Brazilian born chef is a master of sushi and runs a successful catering business.

24539687,"But this is not the latest NFL game at Wembley, rather it is the equally bone-jarring mixed martial arts event in Manchester staged by the UFC, the leading promoter in a sport known in street vernacular as ""cage fighting"".
Casino owner Lorenzo Fertitta and his brother Frank bought the UFC - the letters stand for Ultimate Fighting Championship - for $2m (ÃÂ£1.24m) back in 2001. Since then its value has soared and it now generates $500m a year in revenues.
From being a sport with a limited TV audience, it is now shown in close to 150 countries, in 28 languages, and broadcast to one billion homes.
But why did the brothers decide to buy into a sport that was on the ropes at the time?
""It was a combination of business sense and love of sport. I thought it had good business potential,"" says Lorenzo, 44.
He said that coming from Las Vegas, he had seen many great boxing bouts in a city dubbed Fight Town - from Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes, to the golden era of the late 1970s and early 1980s featuring Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran, and then into the Mike Tyson era.
""But when I looked at boxing, I felt it was a broken business in many ways, with a short-term vision from a business perspective,"" Mr Fertitta says.
It is a business that has been around for 100 years, makes millions in revenues, but has no real brand value, he adds.
""Then we came across the UFC and felt there was value in the brand.""
He said that the UFC brand had transcended the sport it promotes - mixed martial arts - and that ""by establishing regulations, and improving health and safety, we could really build something"".
""Combat sports are one of the few that can be transferred across a global stage,"" he adds.
""Sometimes sports - cricket for example - just don't travel well. We take two world class athletes, and let them use the martial arts they want.""
After their purchase, the Fertittas regulated the sport, looked after the fighters, introduced marketing and sold TV rights.
In the ring they eliminated the fouls that had caused US senator John McCain to once call it ""human cockfighting"" - including eye-gouging, groin attacks, and head-butting.
""We took a step back, we knew we were dealing with a sport that had a controversial background,"" says Mr Fertitta.
""We crafted rules and regulations. We looked at Olympic Games combat sports, and took the rules and regulations from Olympic boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, taekwondo, and judo.
""That is our sport, a combination of those four. The Olympics defined our health and safety rules.""
He says that based on revenues and profitability, the UFC brand is now in the top echelon of global sports franchises, alongside the likes of Manchester United, the Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees.
Current big name sponsors include Gillette, Ford, P&G, and Disney.
The UFC's core base of fans are males aged 18 to 34, but in some markets, notably Brazil, there is a strong female interest.
He says the sport - helped by a strong social-media presence - is creating fans in a different demographic from boxing, which he says is increasingly seen as ""your father's sport"".
UFC mixed martial arts has a healthy pay-TV audience in the US and Canada, and a growing viewership in Brazil, where many of the top fighters are from.  In North America the UFC is now looking at establishing its own viewing channels.
Whereas previous strategy has very much been aimed at the US, their global ambitions are now turned to Asia and Europe, with BT Sport signed up for regular TV programming in the UK.
""Local programming in prime time - that will broaden audience access, and help us break through to our British fan base,"" says Mr Fertitta.
To grow the sport, the UFC a year ago hired Gary Cook - the former chief executive of Manchester City football club - with responsibility for the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, and whose brief includes getting more coverage on to primetime slots.
He is also in the process of organising a series of European fights in major cities such as London, Berlin, Stockholm and Istanbul.
Next year, a successful American gym business is also being exported to Europe, where people can practise different martial arts under one roof. There will be a tie-in UFC fitness DVD, and there are also high hopes for an EA computer game coming out early next year.
Back in the US, there are a couple of flies in the ointment - the refusal of New York state to sanction the sport,  and allegations by some fighters that they are not fairly paid.
Mr Fertitta puts the New York impasse down to a dispute about union representation in his Las Vegas group Station Casinos spilling over into the New York legislative process.
On fighter pay, he says: ""You get paid for performance. You don't hear the guys who are successful complaining. We also have a vibrant 'middle class' of fighters - guys who will never be world champion, but still make a good living.""
Two of the top fighters competing in Manchester on Saturday, will be in the bout between American Mark Munoz and Brazilian Lyoto Machida, with the latter replacing injured UK fighter Michael Bisping.
Mr Fertitta does not believe the British fighter's withdrawal will hit attendances at the Phones 4U Arena event.
But he adds: ""We don't just want to be another American sport that rolls in and rolls out again, we want to create a truly European sport, with homegrown talent for a homegrown audience.""","The latest in a series of US sporting exports goes under the spotlight in the UK this weekend, looking to build a fan base and television audience away from its spiritual home."
33362059,"As often, his given surname was a reference to where he came from; or rather, in this case, where he was studying, the city of Kairouan.
It has since emerged that Seifddine Rezgui had completed the first year of his masters degree only two weeks before he carried out a massacre of at least 38 people.
Teachers and officials of Kairouan's Institute of Applied Science and Technology are adamant: Rezgui was a ""normal student"" throughout the four years that he spent there.
Was it Kairouan that turned the 23-year-old into a ""soldier of the caliphate""?
The ancient city, located in the centre of Tunisia at an almost equal distance from the sea and the mountains, is one of the oldest Islamic centres in the world.
Over the past few days, residents have been keen to tell journalists that it is not a place of ""terrorists.""
Until recently, tourists would flock into Kairouan's narrow and windy streets surrounded by ramparts to visit its remarkable monuments.
A World Heritage Site, it is home to the Mosque of the Three Doors, the oldest known mosque with a sculpted facade.
At the heart of the old part of town, the Great Mosque, with its marble columns, is described by Unesco as ""an architectural masterpiece that served as a model for several other Maghreban mosques"".
Kairouan was founded in 670 and remained the capital of the Muslim world in North Africa for four centuries.
Tunis was then chosen as the political capital in the 12th Century, but Kairouan remained the main holy city in the Maghreb.
""The city was largely marginalised under [former President Zine El Abidine] Ben Ali, and Islamist extremists took control of Kairouan after the 2011 revolution,"" says Alaya Allani, an analyst of terror groups.
In the two years following the overthrow of Ben Ali, Salafist Islamic fundamentalists and radicals took control of dozens of mosques  in the city and gained ground through charity and humanitarian actions.
As in many other towns in Tunisia, preaching tents were erected on a weekly basis in front of schools and supermarkets to attract followers.
This is how the extremist group Ansar al-Sharia rapidly grew, undisturbed by the new Islamist administration.
Its members want to re-create the ancient North African caliphate, and reinstate Kairouan as the capital.
But the town was not a jihadist stronghold, according to Mr Allani.
""It was more a place for radical theoretical work rather than jihadism,"" he says.
Jihadist fighters would rather emerge from the towns of Bizerte, Djendouba, Kasserine or Sidi Bouzid.
""But they have created sleeping cells in Kairouan, and these are still active,"" Mr Allani says.
In 2013, Ansar al-Sharia was labelled a terrorist group and the government clamped down on the organisation, neutralising most of its domestic capacity.
While many have been arrested, hundreds of members - from around the country - are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight within the ranks of IS.
Fedi Saidi, head of the General Student Union of Tunisia's Kairouan branch, told BBC News at least 25 students had travelled to Syria to fight.
He added he had warned the city's authorities last month that an attack could be imminent, giving them the details of the students who had travelled to Syria.
But Abdelwaheb Alouini, from the Kairouan police, said: ""We hear some warnings every day.
""Sometimes they're correct, but sometimes they're not.
""You can't imagine the effort we make every day to protect our country from terrorism.""
If Seifddine Rezgui was being groomed to commit a massacre, he never showed signs of extremism.
He did not even grow a beard or change his clothing style.
""It is quite possible that he was being seduced by radical views over the internet and Kairouan simply provided the right environment for them to grow in his head,"" Mr Allani says.
Like many youths, Nada Mrabet decided to adopt that ideology after the revolution.
""It was out of desperation. I was under a lot of pressure, and sometimes you feel like you need to cooperate with the community you live in,"" she told the BBC.
""So we tried to embrace the way they think, so that we wouldn't get into too much trouble.
""Now, I have decided to change and be independent.
""You can have a lot of enemies just for saying what you think.""
Kairouan has inspired another extremist group, known as Okba Ibn Nafaa and linked to al-Qaeda.
In fact, its name is that of the city's founder, who also commissioned the building of the Great Mosque.
Security officials allege Okba Ibn Nafaa was behind the attack on the Bardo museum in Tunis in March, in which 21 tourists and a Tunisian were killed.
""It is probably the most dangerous group in Tunisia right now,"" says Mr Allani.
""Its members - most of whom are Algerian - have spent much time in training abroad, they are a lot more experienced.""
History and culture are very much palpable in Kairouan, with its medina, surrounded by 3km (two miles) of walls, and a skyline punctuated by the minarets and domes of its mosques and monuments.
Extremists have been trying to claim it back, but along the winding streets, residents who have sighted foreigners give us a gentle: ""Welcome.""
""Please don't speak badly of our town,"" one man said.
""There are no terrorists here, we are good people.""
The names of those killed in the attack are being released. Here's what we know so far about those who lost their lives, as well as those who are injured and missing.
Some survivors have also been speaking out about their ordeal.","When the so-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for last week's attack at the beach resort of Sousse in Tunisia, it celebrated the gunman, Seifddine Rezgui, by his nom de guerre, Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani."
15475498,"Kenya's government is trying to sound confident. The deputy interior minister assured me that the country was ""safe for tourists"", and that foreigners have no reason to stay away despite clear threats from the militant Somali group al-Shabab.
Let us hope he is right. Kenya's vital tourism sector has fallen victim in the past to unnecessarily shrill foreign travel advisories.
But Kenya's unexpected military incursion into southern Somalia is a dramatic development for a country that has spent years carefully trying to avoid just such an entanglement.
So was it a mistake? That seems to be the main question on the lips of aid workers, diplomats and a variety of officials I have been speaking to here over the past few days.
Some Somali experts believe this was a long-planned operation, arranged with the covert support of the US and other western allies.
The theory goes that the recent kidnappings of foreigners in Kenya were merely a convenient pretext for the invasion - that al-Shabab has been fatally weakened by its ""horrific ineptitude"" in the face of the famine and its dwindling foreign support, and that the next few months could see the militant group ousted from its key port of Kismayo and effectively finished off inside Somalia.
A slightly more modest theory holds that Kenya has indeed been planning for a limited military intervention to build a more effective buffer zone along the border inside Somalia - where it already co-operates with various ineffective local militias opposed to al-Shabab and into which it intends to push some of the tens of thousands of Somali refugees now camped in Kenya.
A senior western aid source told me that the UN secretary general has already called Kenya's prime minister to warn him against any attempt to violate international law by expelling refugees.
Then there is the chaos theory. Kenya - enraged by the kidnappings and the damage to its tourism industry and development plans - lashed out without warning or much planning, catching everyone off guard and sending its untested army into what could well prove to be a very dangerous trap.
My sense is that Kenya has been planning something for a while - but there is huge confusion about its tactics, goals and exit strategy.
At this stage, if feels like a potentially huge mistake for one of Africa's most dynamic economies.
Already there are concerns that Kenyan troops are getting bogged down by seasonal rains and struggling to re-supply.
Al-Shabab has offered little resistance so far, but that seems likely to change amid reports that the group is rushing experienced fighters to the frontlines.
If this is a trap, it could be sprung very soon.
As for the strength of al-Shabab - there's no question that an already fragmented organisation has been weakened.
But in recent weeks it has still managed to pull off a string of spectacular attacks in Mogadishu, culminating in the ambush and elimination of an entire Burundian peacekeeping platoon, which, despite official denials, appears to have caused the death of more than 60 soldiers.
And what if the Kenyan offensive goes well, and Kismayo falls?
Al-Shabab may retreat but the vacuum will inevitably be filled by a wasp's nest of other clan rivalries.
Or does Kenya plan to stay on, perhaps looking for an international peacekeeping mandate?
The Ethiopians - who also pushed into Somalia in 2006 - will be watching Kenya's fortunes closely.
As for what impact all this could have on Somalia's famine - I will write about that in more detail in another blog, but the UN has already expressed concern and, with planting season at hand, it is hard to imagine how an upsurge in fighting could be anything but bad news for Somalia's vulnerable population.","The international hotels here are starting to empty; the restaurants and bars are bringing their tables in off the streets; and a queasy, quiet sense of dread is coiling itself round Nairobi, as the country waits to see what - beyond the two grenade attacks this week - Kenya's military offensive inside neighbouring Somalia might yet provoke by way of retaliation."
29687248,"Sources stress that no final decisions have yet been made on what the specific measures will be, how they will be announced (ie whether in a speech or an article or an interview) or when they'll be made (ie before or after the Rochester by-election).
Yesterday's Sunday Times story about a possible limit to the number of national insurance numbers issued to new arrivals from the EU is said to draw on current practice in Croatia - the latest country to join the EU.
British workers wanting to live and work in Croatia for more than three months need a work permit which - according to one website - requires:
These requirements also apply to citizens of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain who have also applied so-called transitional controls limiting free movement for the first seven years of Croatia's EU membership - up until 2020.
It is unclear how or whether this regime could be applied to an existing member state though, perhaps, it suggests that it could be possible provided the restrictions work in both directions.
This is just one of a number of options being considered, I'm told. Last week another possibility emerged - a so-called ""emergency brake"" mechanism which would allow a country to stop migration after it reached a certain level.
This has never previously been used to stop immigration and EU officials are fond of pointing out that at the same time as immigration levels to the UK are high unemployment levels are much lower than other EU countries - suggesting, they argue, that there is no evidence that immigrants take the jobs of UK workers.
Several countries - German, Austria and the Netherlands - have already agreed to the desirability of limiting benefit payments to the families of migrants and changing the so-called transitional arrangements which apply when countries join the EU.
However, as yet, there is no sign of any other country wanting limits to the total numbers allowed to move from one EU country to another.
There is some frustration amongst the prime minister's advisers that ideas are leaking out before they have had proper time to assess them.
That, of course, is the problem with simultaneously trying to solve a political problem - the rise of UKIP - by talking up how tough you'll be in Europe at the same time as considering whether any of your promises will be agreed to by 27 other EU countries.",The prime minister will announce plans to limit EU migration before Christmas but the search is still on for a way to do this without needing to re-write the founding treaty of the EU - the Treaty of Rome - which enshrines the principle of the freedom of movement of people.
36502264,"If there are euro-fireworks, the most likely flashpoints are at the Commons question times - where Home Office, Justice, Cabinet Office (in charge of the online voter registration system, remember) and Prime Minister's questions all provide rich opportunities for the referendum campaigns to have a go at each other.
And with increasing ""blue on blue"" attacks in recent days normal parliamentary politesse may be in short supply.
The other big event will be the result of the election for a new Lord Speaker, to take over from Baroness D'Souza, in September. The election was held on Wednesday 8 June, but - as with the Speakership of the Commons - the result could not be confirmed until the winner had received the Royal Approbation, the approval of the Queen. The former health secretary, Lord Fowler, is the favourite.
The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Home Office questions - and any post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will be taken at 3.30pm.
Then MPs move on to another big day of report stage proceedings on the Policing and Crime Bill. It may not be quite as intricate as the previous week's action on the Investigatory Powers Bill, but, as often happens with this type of criminal law bill, there are all kinds of amendments raining down from many different sources. There are plenty of issues attracting attention.
Labour will have amendments down on a series of ""victims' rights"" issues - some inspired by the Hillsborough case, where shadow home secretary Andy Burnham has been active. A particular issue is ensuring some equality between victims or their relatives, and public authorities, in inquests and court cases, where they are often ranged against high-powered taxpayer-funded QCs.
Labour will also be attempting to build some of the provisions of former DPP Kier Starmer's unsuccessful private member's bill on rights and entitlements of victims, from last year, into this bill.
One of the big areas of interest is the treatment of mental health in the criminal justice system: Labour have a new clause (NC24) on the right to an independent mental health advocate. The Conservative backbencher and mental health campaigner Charles Walker has NC2 which says that someone detained against their will in a place of safety shall have the right to independent legal advice, and another NC42 that would require the home secretary to be notified whenever police officers are deployed on psychiatric wards.
And the Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb offers NC40 banning the use of tasers on psychiatric wards. He has another amendment calling for people not to be removed to a place of safety that is a police station, except when their behaviour is so extreme they cannot be safely managed and no alternative place of safety is available.
Another big subject area is child sexual exploitation where Mr Lamb pops up again with NC45 which requires that when the police or a local authority think a child has been sexually exploited or abused, they must refer them for assessment and make any necessary arrangements for their treatment or care. There's a cross-party new clause, NC25, along similar lines, to enable the Future in Mind report's recommendation that young people who have been sexually abused or exploited should receive a comprehensive initial assessment, and referral to appropriate services.
There's cross party backing for NC6 to create the offence of abduction of a vulnerable child aged 16 or 17 - which is signed by Labour's Sarah Champion, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts, the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, and the Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael. And a similar list of names appears on NC10, on the prevention of child sexual exploitation and private hire vehicles which would place local authorities under a duty to consider how they can prevent child sexual exploitation when they issue licences for taxis and private hire vehicles
Labour's Ann Coffey, who led an inquiry by an all-party group into sexual exploitation has new clauses NC14 and NC13 creating prevention orders to stop grooming for criminal behaviour. Then there's NC18 from the Conservative Kit Malthouse to increase the maximum sentence for child cruelty from 10 years in jail to 14. Another new clause from Mr Malthouse, NC15, calls for a review of sentencing guidelines on crime against children and crimes where the victim is a child.  And he also has NC16 which allow the police to apply for an order to mobile phone providers to block numbers on cards advertising prostitution.

Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts has a series of clauses to give the National Assembly for Wales responsibility for policing - giving powers over policing, police pay, probation, community safety, and crime. And she also picks up the interest in cyber-crime taken by her Plaid predecessor Elfyn Llwyd with NC3  calling for a review of digital crime legislation with a view to consolidating it into a single statute.  And she wants to add to the legislation with NC4 which would outlaw various forms of ""cyberstalking"" - it would become an offence to use a digital device to repeatedly locate, listen to or watch a person without legitimate purpose, to install spyware, a webcam or any other device or software on another person's property or digital device without permission. The clause lists a whole series of cyberstalking practices and it also calls for restrictions on the sale of spyware to under-16 s and require anyone purchasing it to state how they intended to use it.
There's an anti-doping clause - NC39  - from Labour's Christina Rees - which would make it an offence to knowingly take a prohibited substance to boost performance. It would cover the entourage of an athlete and medical professionals who prescribe a prohibited substance.
The Lib Dem former Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael has two new clauses NC46 and NC47 on revenge pornography, making the disclosure of private sexual images with intent to cause distress an offence and providing a mechanism for compensation.
The normal report stage caveats apply - not all of the above will be discussed - and some of the amendments and new clauses will be aimed more at pressing ministers to respond to an issue than at getting written into law. Look out for assurances that changes will be brought forward when the bill reaches the Lords... and look out for close votes on particular subjects, because that often provides a cue for peers to revisit the issue
In Westminster Hall from 4.30pm - 7.30pm MPs will debate e-petition 125692, entitled Stop spending a fixed 0.7% slice of our national wealth on Foreign Aid.
In the Lords, from 2.30pm peers will hear the result of their election for a new Lord Speaker. Then, after the regular half hour question time, they debate reports from two select committees: the Digital Skills Committee and the European Union Committee report on EU energy governance.
The Commons meets at 11.30am for Justice questions and then they have the second reading of the Wales Bill - which sets out new powers to be transferred to the National Assembly for Wales or Welsh ministers.
It also changes the basis on which the Assembly operated by moving to a ""reserved powers model"" along the lines of the devolution settlement in Scotland. The aim is to provide a clearer separation of powers between what is devolved and what is reserved to Westminster, allowing the Assembly to legislate on any subject not specifically reserved to Parliament.
The day's Adjournment Debate is on provision for air passengers with dementia - led by the Conservative, Oliver Colvile.
In Westminster Hall, there are debates on affordable housing in London (9.30am-11am); plutonium disposition (11am-11.30am); West Coast Rail franchise (2.30pm-4pm) and elected mayors outside city regions (4.30pm-5.30pm).
In the Lords (from 2.30pm), after the usual half hour of questions to ministers, the main event is the second reading of the Children and Social Work Bill - Labour's Lord Watson of Invergowrie will put down an early marker expressing the Opposition's displeasure that so many of the core provisions will be left to regulations, to be published later. This runs against the recommendation of the Constitution, Secondary Legislation and Delegated Powers Committees of the Lords, who're concerned that too much major policy is pushed through when ""skeleton bills"" are fleshed out, after they've been passed. The argument is that this undermines proper scrutiny.
This is particularly important, Labour say, when Clauses 20 - 40 of the bill provide for the secretary of state to set up a new regulator of social workers (which could actually be the secretary of state).
This power and all details relating to the new regulator are left to secondary legislation which the House has yet to see - and the Labour calls on the government to publish the draft regulations before the House considers those clauses in committee.
The Commons begins (11.30am) with Cabinet Office questions - followed at noon by the last Prime Minister's question time before the EU referendum, which will doubtless be a pretty charged occasion. Afterwards, the euro-vibe will continue with a Labour Opposition Day debate on the economic benefits of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union.
They don't normally nominate the subject of their debates as early as this - but on this occasion, I suppose, it's a no-brainer.
In Westminster Hall, the debates cover jobs and livelihoods in developing countries, led by Conservative development specialist Jeremy Lefroy (9.30am-11am); infrastructure and regulations to support electric and low-emission vehicles (11am-11.30am); further education colleges and skills in Greater Manchester (2.30pm- 4pm); support for social investment (4pm-4.30pm) and, finally the Conservative Wendy Morton has a debate (4.30pm-5.30pm) aimed at highlighting the effect of the EU's proposals to achieve a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 on the UK ceramics industry - a big employer in her West Midlands constituency - it may have to buy all its carbon allowance after 2021, imposing what she warns will be ""a huge economic burden"".
In the Lords, 11am question time is followed by a debate on a series of European Union Committee select committee reports on ""The EU referendum and EU reform"", ""The process of withdrawing from the European Union"", plus the Science and Technology Committee report on  ""EU Membership and UK Science"".
And then there is a debate on the European Union Committee reports on ""The EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling"" and ""Operation Sophia, the EU's naval mission in the Mediterranean: an impossible challenge"".
And with that, Parliament rises for the EU referendum.
MPs and Peers are due to return on 27 June - there's even a published agenda. But whether they stick to it rather depends on the referendum result. They may even come back for a Saturday sitting - the first since the Falklands War - if there is a vote to leave. Certainly there are contingency plans in place, for that eventuality.","There's some high-powered law-making to be done this week - on policing and crime, and children and social work - but I can't help wondering whether our parliamentarians might be going through the motions a bit, making their final three sitting days before the special referendum recess a kind of phoney war period."
39258421,"A few days after early voting had begun in Florida last October, an 84-year-old woman called Mary Ellen Klas, the state capital bureau chief of the Miami Herald, with an urgent question.
Was there anyway she could take back her vote?
Klas told the woman that wasn't going to be possible - there are no do-overs in voting.
But the woman didn't want to change her vote for president - she wanted to undo her vote on a Florida ballot measure, Amendment 1.
Amendment 1 read simply, asking voters if there should be ""a right under Florida's constitution for consumers to own or lease solar equipment"".
The woman on the phone had voted Yes. She, like 89% of Americans in a recent survey, supported expanding solar power in some way.
But she wanted to switch her vote because of a story Klas had just published.
A leaked recording all but confirmed what editorials in Florida papers and opponents had been arguing for months: the amendment was a deliberately misleading effort, aimed at drastically limiting solar competition.
""Your article came one day too late,"" she told Klas, vowing to tell all her friends to vote no. ""I read it and I almost cried.""
In 2015, a group called Floridians for Solar Choice begin petitioning for a ballot amendment that would allow state residents to set up contracts with third party companies that install solar panels for no cost and in return, sell the energy produced back to the consumer.
Across the US, utility firms see such companies as a threat, as they reduce revenues from residential consumers who are otherwise still connected to their grid.
A competing amendment by a group called Consumers for Smart Solar cropped up, titled ""Rights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice"". The title sounded similar and the language seemed to indicate the amendment would be broadly pro-solar, promising a right to ""own or lease solar equipment"".
But instead of being backed by renewable energy and environmental groups, the Smart Solar group was funded by Florida utilities.
The issue was the second half of the utility-backed amendment: non-solar consumers would be ""not required to subsidize"" solar installations. Critics saw this as a way of constitutionally enshrining raised fees to make third-party solar prohibitively expensive.
""We need more solar in Florida and we need it to be done in a way that is fair, transparent and protects all consumers,"" said Ana Gibbs, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, one of the major utility firms who supported Consumers for Smart Solar.
Both sides were soliciting signatures for ""the solar amendment"" says Josh Gillin, a reporter at the Tampa Bay Times and contributor to PolitiFact Florida. ""There were reports of people saying 'Well I already signed for that',"" Gillin says.
In the end, Consumers for Smart Solar got the signatures needed, and was listed on the ballot as Amendment 1. Floridians for Solar Choice admitted they would not get the required signatures in time, and began switching their efforts to organising a No campaign against Amendment 1.
Consumers for Smart Solar also won a legal battle in early 2016 challenging the amendment's wording.
In a 4-3 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court said the amendment could go forward. But one of the judges in the minority called the amendment ""a wolf in sheep's clothing"", writing that the ballot's title was ""misleading"".
Consumers for Smart Solar's Yes on 1 began their campaign in earnest - TV advertisements, direct mail and opinion pieces. Many voters received four or five pieces of mail from the group, Klas says.
They also targeted their messaging for Florida's large elderly population - claiming the amendment would protect seniors from scams, despite the amendment language guaranteeing no such thing. Some leaders in Florida's black and Latino communities came on board, swayed by argument that third-party solar would ultimately raise electricity rates on Florida's poorest.
By the end of the election, Consumers for Smart Solar had raised $27m (Â£21m) for the campaign - $20m of that from utility companies, and the vast majority of the rest by political organisations not required to disclose their donors or coalition groups.
Floridians for Solar Choice raised about a tenth of that - $2.5m. Most of it was donated by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) action fund - also not required to disclose their donors - and from environmental groups, solar industry groups and several hundred individuals.
""I don't think people thought we could win,"" Susan Glickman, Florida Director for SACE Action Fund says. ""It's a big state, lots of media markets...It's a real investment.""
Meanwhile, Florida newspaper editorial boards invited both groups in to make their case.
""We really bent over backward to be as open minded as possible,"" says Paul Owens, opinions editor of the Orlando Sentinel. ""We met with groups on both sidesâ¦for at least an hour [each].""
After the meetings, Owens' team did their own reporting and ultimately decided they would advise their readers to vote no.
""Energy seems to be an area that's changing rapidly,"" Owens says ""We didn't think that was a good idea to lock something in a rapidly changing policy area in the constitution.""
But how the amendment came to the ballot also affected their decision.
""The major utilities in Florida had invested so much money into this,"" Owens says. ""Of course, they were saying they were doing it on behalf of the consumers. But,"" - he laughs - "" we were a little sceptical.""
Owens and the Sentinel eventually wrote two separate editorials opposing amendment one, and they weren't alone. More than two dozen Florida newspaper editorial boards all came out against the amendment.
When asked if the firm is concerned about being associated with what many editorials called a misleading amendment, Gibbs says Duke Energy ""believes our numbers speak for themselves"" and described the firm's own solar installations and projects.
The No on 1 campaign was losing the fundraising race, but they had an odd and energised coalition on their side - environmental groups, solar firms, Christian conservatives and Tea Party groups frustrated over state utility monopolies.
As the editorials came out, they ran with them.
""We were on radio, on debates, on Facebook Live,"" Glickman said. ""People were emailing their list - the Christian Coalition - that's a couple hundred thousand of people.""
Their language was easy to get across, Glickman says. ""People understood - the only reason utilities spent [millions] was to help themselves.""
A tech millionaire ran his own $100,000 internet marketing campaign against the amendment, telling Klas he had ""nothing against power companies"" but disliked ""companies try to fool me"".
""Margaritaville"" singer Jimmy buffet recorded a video in opposition. Even Al Gore got angry about it (and got fact checked himself).
In order to pass, the amendment need 60% support. But polling had showed support as high as 84% in September. Two weeks before the election, it had dropped - but only to 60%.
And then Klas got a scoop.
It was an audio recording of Sal Nuzzo, a policy director at James Madison Institute, a think tank hired by Consumers for Smart Solar, calling the amendment campaign ""an incredibly savvy manoeuvre"" that ""would completely negate anything they [pro-solar interests] would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road"".
Nuzzo, who was speaking at a conference put on by the think tank, suggested political operatives in other states could ""use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu and take what they're kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy, in legislation or in constitutional referendums"".
""As you guys look at policy in your state, or constitutional ballot initiatives in your state, remember this: solar polls very well,"" Nuzzo said.
The reaction to the leaked recording was quick. More editorials came out. Yes on 1 removed all references to the James Madison Institute on their website. A fire fighting union rescinded their endorsement of the amendment and demanded the group stop airing television ads featuring fire-fighters.
""It was confirming a narrative,"" Klas says. ""It's got that 'Hey Mabel"" quality to it - oh what's this story? I should pay attention.""
And readers paid attention - and shared. ""It was picked up on Facebook and recirculated,"" Klas says, adding reader engagement with the story made it one of the largest political stories of the year for the Herald. ""People read to the end.""
But without the leaked recording, would Amendment 1 have lost?
""You know, I still think we would have won,"" Glickman says, but ""it was close"".
Klas thinks it was a combination of multiple factors: an organised, if underfunded, opposition, the tape, the editorials, the drip-drip of bad news near the election.
But she's not convinced the experience will change how amendment campaigns are run.
""I think they got caught,"" she says.
""I think they are going to make sure they are not going to get caught again.""","As the US deals with a president who tweets stories his own staff don't believe, and an environmental chief who denies carbon emissions are the primary driver of climate change, a Florida election fight shows the ups and downs of dealing with the politics of confusion around climate and energy policy."
32395803,"The grainy nature of the footage, which subsequently went viral, suggests this was a spontaneous, off-the-cuff moment captured on a mobile phone - but Mr Abbott's relaxed demeanour and willingness to take on the ""manly"" challenge set by a group of younger men is likely to have left his image managers smiling.
Appearing down to earth and at ease with the voters they encounter seems to be regarded as the elixir of modern, (still) male-dominated politics in many countries. The process began in the television age and has now been sharpened by an internet age in which videos and photos are posted, shared and re-shared at warp speed.
Appearing out of touch, on the other hand, is regarded as political Kryptonite.
Mr Abbott is not the first Australian politician whose timed beer-drinking exploits have become part of his public image.
Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke went so far as to describe his downing of two-and-a-half pints (1.4 litres) of ale in 11 seconds while a student at Oxford University as something that ""was to endear me to some of my fellow Australians more than anything else I ever achieved"".
For David Briggs, of Australian polling and research organisation Galaxy International, there is an upside to politicians like Tony Abbott being seen as a ""normal bloke"".
""It certainly beats being written off as an arrogant tosser,"" he says frankly.
But this effect is hard to read when examining opinion polls, Mr Briggs says, as perceptions of parliamentary leaders do not change dramatically in the short term.
However, polling evidence suggests that the revelation in 2007 that then Australian opposition leader Kevin Rudd had visited a strip club during a visit to the US actually worked in his favour.
""Some suggested this confirmed he suffered poor judgement and was not a suitable prime minister,"" says Mr Briggs. ""However, our poll conducted at the time confirmed that to the overwhelming majority of Australian voters, this incident simply demonstrated that he was a normal bloke.
""This view was shared by both men and women... with his reputation as a normal bloke enhanced, he went on to win a federal election a few months later.""
But then this can also work the other way. To the despair of their image-makers, some politicians' attempts to forge a bond with ordinary folk often come to grief.
Former UK opposition leader William Hague's claim to have drunk 14 pints of beer a day in his younger days was mocked at the time, as was then Prime Minister Tony Blair's apparent adoption of ""estuary English"" while appearing on a popular TV chat show.
More recently in the UK, footage of Labour leader Ed Miliband eating a bacon sandwich was seen as reinforcing his slightly geeky image, while Prime Minister David Cameron's attempts to avoid this pitfall by eating a hotdog with a knife and fork provoked further criticism of his alleged aloofness.
By contrast, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage's fondness for a pint of beer and a cigarette - a key part of this former stockbroker's image package - has become his trademark.
In the US, then Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's attempt in 2012 to reach out to the people of Detroit - the city at the heart of the US car industry - by telling an audience there that his wife owned a ""couple of Cadillacs"" hardly burnished his man-of-the people credentials.
But then neither did Barack Obama's attempt to reach out to regular voters by taking up ten-pin bowling during his first successful campaign to become president in 2008.
Still in the US, many political observers cite George W Bush as a good example of a politician successfully connecting with crucial undecided voters.
He won the 2000 and 2004 presidential polls partly because - the argument goes - he was better able to convince the average American that he was quite like them and would be more fun to have a night out with than the stiffer, more intellectual Al Gore and John Kerry.
This was despite Mr Bush's impeccable establishment credentials as the scion of an oil-wealthy Texas family, whose father had been head of the CIA before becoming vice-president and then president.
Indeed, the younger Bush once joked to a wealthy audience at a (pre-financial crisis) charity dinner: ""This is an impressive crowd. The haves and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite. I call you my base.""
A counterpoint can be found in the political scene in Israel, where for decades the ""uniform"" of Israeli male politicians was casual dress - usually the short-sleeved, open-necked shirt paired with shorts or casual trousers favoured by Israel's founding father and first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.
It is unclear whether this reflected the straight-talking informality of a new state founded in war, a practical response to the local climate - or an attempt by the politicians to sell themselves as leadership material by appearing ordinary yet dynamic.
In her novel Love and Betrayal, author Pamela Schieber refers to most Israeli politicians of the 1960s and 70s as looking ""like they had just jumped off the kibbutz tractor"".
But this trend has been largely abandoned in the following decades, with many Israeli politicians - including the most successful one of the modern era, Benjamin Netanyahu - now favouring the bankers' uniform of sharp suits and bright ties for public appearances.
For Nick Wood, chief executive of the public relations firm Media Intelligence Partners and a former adviser to UK Conservative leaders William Hague and Iain Duncan-Smith, authenticity is all.
""People don't expect their prime ministers to be just like them, they are not so naive as to believe that - and nor do they want that. What they want is empathy, a feeling for what life is like for ordinary people.
""As long as politicians are doing something that fits with who they are, is part of their persona, it works. Faked stunts just don't work.""","Footage of Tony Abbott downing a beer in short order at the weekend to the cheers of young sportsmen in a Sydney pub has polarised opinion in Australia, with some commending the prime minister for showing he is a ""regular bloke"" and others shaking their heads at what they regard as overly macho, unstatesmanlike behaviour."
36712829,"Geraldine Pilgrim's Flight sets the lives of those men in the context of aviation history, using as a backdrop, the rich heritage of the area where it is being staged.
Cumbria's links to aviation are strong - it was the birthplace of Britain's first seaplane, Waterbird, and one of the first British military airships, and its involvement with both made it a hotbed for would-be pilots in the pre-war years.
Pilgrim says she found their stories and the way their simple desire to fly led to their involvement in the war ""completely extraordinary and tragic"".
The men were based at Hill of Oaks on the banks of Windermere, from where Waterbird took its first flight in 1911 and which became a Royal Naval Air Service base during the war.
""Not many people know about its importance,"" says Pilgrim.
""The Hill of Oaks became a pilot training school and these young men that just wanted to fly actually got caught up in World War One.
""They became known as the 'Suicide Club' because they were only in the air for a maximum of 11 days before they were shot down.""
She says what that name made her realise was ""the enormity of the loss to the people that were left behind"", a feeling which she hopes to convey in her ""site-specific performance journey"".
""One of the images I'm thinking of is the women waiting for their boys - whether they were sons, fathers, brothers, husbands, boyfriends - to come home.
""I imagined the women looking up at the sky over the Lake District, waiting for them to come back, a bit like migrating birds coming home.
""The poignancy is that so many of them waited and waited but their boys never came back.""
She says, that while that is undoubtedly a sad image, ""I want people to be moved but I don't want them to feel unhappy"".
""It's not melancholy - we live in troubled enough times at the moment. I want it to be poignant,"" she says.

The show is being put on at Brockhole, a ""wonderful arts and craft designed building"" beside Windermere which Pilgrim says lost many of its period features after being sold to Liverpool Health Authority in 1945.
""It was neutralised and made into one of those bland office spaces. It broke my heart when I saw it.
""Part of what we're doing is transforming the top floor and repapering the hallway with period wallpaper.
""We're giving back Brockhole some of the care and attention that it deserves.""
She says it is an important part of the process that is driving the performance - that the project ""is for and about Cumbria"".
""This was once a much loved family home and we want to make sure it still feels like it's loved and cared for.
""It is [loved] by many people in the area and they felt like it needed a bit of tender care.""
Those people are also involved in the piece, as volunteers from Westmoreland Croquet Club, Burneside Brass Band, Ashton Family Theatre, Ambleside Theatre, the University of Cumbria and Kendal College are taking roles, along with several local families.
Sue Larkin got involved after her daughter encouraged her to go to a meeting with the artist about the project.
She says being made ""to stop and consider the reality for the people portrayed is very sobering"".
""I think that we can all appreciate how people's feelings about the war changed.
""Everyone was so proud and excited at the start but the reality, for so many, was devastating.
""I had never appreciated how many women never married because so many young men went to war and never come home.
""And as I watch the teenagers I am acting with in my scene, keeping in constant touch with their mates via social media throughout the evening, it is also hard to imagine what it was really like to have to wait so long for any news of your loved ones.
""It must have been almost unbearable.""
Larkin says that even though she has lived in the area for 20 years, she was ""not aware of any of the stories about the families or the airmen and women"" before being told about them by Pilgrim.
The artist says she is not alone in that as, for many volunteers, it is all ""genuinely new"" - and for herself, raising awareness was one of the main aims of her project.
""What I want to do is help people learn more about their own history.
""Not in a patronising way, because I'm not from here, but I've had a chance to particularly research the area.

35118740,"Everybody remembers when Tintin went to Tibet, but not what happened when Sue was there.
While browsing around a tiny second-hand bookshop in Nottingham, I came across a dusty, worn cloth-covered out-of-print book entitled ""Sue in Tibet"". As a scholar of Tibetan studies, I was familiar with Tibet-based adventure and mystery novels published in the 1920s, but these were invariably centred on the stories of the men.
This was intriguing because it looked like it could be the first piece of western children's literature ever set in Tibet, and its main character was a teenage girl. Published in 1942, it tells the story of Sue Shelby, the eldest daughter of an American missionary family stationed in the remote Tibetan border town of Batang.
Set against the backdrop of rampant banditry and skirmishes between Tibetan and Chinese soldiers, it begins with the dangerous journey on horseback across snow-capped mountains by Sue's family before they eventually settle in Batang. By the end Sue, fluent in Chinese and Tibetan, acts as an interpreter at a crucial military conference, so ensuring peace at a time of unrest.
Its observations are astonishingly accurate - because it is based very closely on the true-life adventures of its author, Dorris Shelton Still. However, her story did not have the same happy ending. As a woman back in the United States, so her children told me, Dorris almost never spoke of her unique childhood.
Like Sue, Dorris was the eldest daughter of the Sheltons, an American missionary family stationed in the remote Sino-Tibetan border town of Batang between 1908 and 1921. Batang was not a strange or exotic land for Dorris, it was home. Clues to the Sheltons' life come from Sue's story too.
Just a few years after the British invasion of Lhasa in 1905 and a subsequent massacre of missionaries and converts by Tibetan lamas in Batang itself, the fictional family are received with a mixture of curiosity, fear and suspicion. Nevertheless, Sue becomes best friends with local girl Nogi, who teaches her to apply yak butter to her skin after bathing. They swap snacks of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for yak meat and dried yak cheese.
Sue even befriends a so-called Living Buddha, known in Tibet as a tulku or reincarnated lama. This story has some basis in reality as one remarkable photograph now held at the Newark Museum shows. It documents the occasion when the Shelton family sat down to a picnic with an incarnate lama who had been disbarred from priestly functions because he fell in love.
As she notes in her memoirs, Dorris never forgot her friends in Batang, and would regularly pine for butter tea and tsampa, the traditional staples of Tibet. Although she longed to return, it was never to be.
But the triumphant climax of Sue in Tibet is where fiction departs from reality. When Sue's father is prevented by injury from acting as interpreter at a crucial military conference, Sue jumps in, and after a gruelling journey on horseback, she saves the day, returning to a heroine's welcome in Batang.
It was not like that for Dorris and her sister, who were dressed like sober American girls and kept to a strict schooling schedule. In 1921, they were sent off to boarding school.
They were never again to see their father, the heroic doctor whom Sue's father is closely based on.
While on a mission to Lhasa to set up a medical centre, he was shot by bandits on the road. He died days later. His family were not there, but a travelling companion later provided a graphic and tragic account of what happened, paying tribute to the doctor's courage and crediting him with saving his life. After the bandits moved on, they found the doctor lying on the side of the road.
""There were blood stains all over his face. I could see a large wound open on his forehead. ""
He was desperate for water, but that was scarce. Nursed for a few days, the doctor knew what was coming once his arm was amputated.
""Ming Shang. I will be gone in a few days, no hope to live, I love you, be a good boy. I have told the other folk to look after you,"" Dr Shelton said.
""I was extremely sad, a man who loved me as his own son, now I had to carry his amputated arm on the back of my horse,"" the account goes on to say.
Even though Dorris went on to write about Sue in Tibet, her children believe the pain of the loss of her father lay behind her personal silence in her later years. Her granddaughter, Andrea Still does recall one conversation, possibly a tribute to Dorris's father's work as a doctor.
""She spoke about ...where Western and Eastern philosophies met with most friction. It was that if someone was injured...in Tibetan culture, they would write a prayer down on a slip of paper, cover the paper in mud and swallow it down while saying prayers and walking in supplication, while the Westerner finds his trusty doctor.""
Tibet clearly  stayed with Dorris. She was involved in raising money to help Tibetan refugees and sponsoring Tibetan businesses in Dharamsala, the Indian city which has become a hub for Tibetan exiles. She also had private audiences with the Dalai Lama.
In many ways, the book was ahead of its time. In the 1940s, out of the 284 children's books published in the US, only 21 had girls as their main characters. Sue, however, is centre-stage. Faced with unfamiliar and dangerous situations, she is an independent and quick-thinking girl with a strong sense of curiosity and a passion for adventure.
It is clearly a reflection of Dorris's spirit too and she wrote about her time in Tibet with a poignant nostalgia in her later journals.
""We were happy youngsters in a beautiful land with friends we loved and endless wonderful things to do.""","Girls did not often star in the adventure stories of the early 20th Century, but the chance discovery of a little-known book by the daughter of an American missionary who lived in a Tibetan border town led researcher Tricia Kehoe to uncover an extraordinary life story, one marred by tragedy."
34422553,"Both clubs had an easy Â£50m or so to spend on central strikers, and the best they could apparently come up with between them was a kid with a handful of goals to his name so far.
While Martial has been a revelation for United, a turbo-charged and cool-headed game-changer in terms of his impact on the team so far, Arsene Wenger was left examining internal solutions.
For Arsenal, who spent most of the transfer window like a teenager agonisingly watching the telephone to see if Karim Benzema's number would flash up, this was particularly frustrating.
Ever since the most prolific striker in their history, Thierry Henry, opined last April that Arsenal couldn't win the Premier League title without an upgrade in that department, the pressure to improve cranked up. ""I'm afraid they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again,"" he said.
It was pretty clear, as far as Henry was concerned, that his compatriot Olivier Giroud was not in that ""top, top quality"" bracket.
It is telling that Theo Walcott was not really a major part of that conversation. At the time he was kicking his heels, mostly on the bench, trying to maintain the right mixture of patience and determination to take a chance when it came having spent a year recovering from a cruciate ligament injury.
More or less all of 2014 was spent rehabilitating, and changing his perspective as he became a father. Arsenal's first choice centre-forward? It was his ambition but it felt like a long shot.
Right now, ahead of a compelling challenge between Arsenal and Manchester United this weekend at the Emirates, the position feels like Walcott's for the taking. He has had to wait a long time to press his case. As he says: ""I'll play anywhere, but the manager started playing me up front slowly.""
Opportunities are now knocking. Wenger's inability to sign anyone in the last transfer window pushed Walcott up the pecking order, which appears to have been advanced even more by Giroud having a difficult time of it lately.
The Frenchman was jeered when he missed some chances for the national team, and sent off in Arsenal's defeat by Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League, and Walcott looks to have eased in front. Giroud was the starter for the first two games of the Premier League campaign. But since then Walcott has started five of the last six Premier League and Champions League fixtures.
Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright recently called for Walcott to be given ""a genuine run of games up thereâ¦ let him prove he can do it"".
He has responded by chipping in with regular goals and assists. His chance conversion still needs to improve, but 12 from 13 Premier League starts is not to be sniffed at. Once he got that unexpected berth to lead the line at the FA Cup final, in which he opened the scoring against Aston Villa, this was always going to be a key season.
His confident body language suggests he feels he belongs up front now and welcomes the responsibility. He also possesses a coolness of character which means he doesn't look affected if he misses a chance, and just concentrates on waiting for the next one.
Can he be the answer? It is still too early to say, but one thing that is clearly different about this campaign is Wenger's attitude towards a player he has worked on for almost a decade. For the first time the manager regards Walcott purely as a central striker.
Every minute of this season he has played so far has been in that role, not at all on the right flank he occupied for a long time, where he could sometimes get lost.
His performance against Leicester last weekend was full of the kind of movement to stretch defences, sharp runs, and strong interplay with team-mates that outline his case well.
The unconvinced point out that Leicester, with their high defensive line and cavalier style, are dream opponents for a speedy player like Walcott to whizz around on the counter-attack. The question of whether he can be as effective in tight home games where buses are parked and spaces squeezed remains in the balance.
If during that sequence of games Wright called for, he can learn to be effective, and make the difference, in those situations Arsenal really might be on to something.
Walcott mentioned Wright's style as an inspiration. ""He obviously scored so many goals and caused havoc for defenders. He wasn't the tallest man in the world but the amount of pressure he would put on defenders just scared them,"" Walcott explained in an interview with Arsenal Player.
""I can learn from the runs he made, the pace he had in his game and his finishing. When he was in the box he didn't panic.""
A connection with Alexis Sanchez is forming. As well as enjoying the space to dash into at Leicester, they created a goal for each other in the Champions League defeat by Olympiakos. It was a bright spot on a dark night for Arsenal, and a positive for Wenger to cling to as they prepare for United's visit.
It seems extraordinary that the England forward will have been at Arsenal long enough to qualify for a testimonial soon. In January he will have been at the club for 10 years.
The manager sees a difference in the 26-year-old these days, and the influence he hopes he can bring. ""When he arrived here he was a boy, a little boy who discovered a world where he did not know anything about it. He has become very mature, he has gone through difficult periods so he is a very strong man today. He can become a prolific goalscorer.""
Henry, who spends so much time around Arsenal these days as he works on his coaching badges, will cast his eye over both Walcott and Martial with considerable interest this weekend.","On the day Anthony Martial's status exploded as the teenager became a luxury-priced prospect for Manchester United, and Arsenal's vain summer search for an elite striker ended in disappointment, it was easy to reach the conclusion that the pool of established, talented forwards at the north London club was worryingly dry."
40019642,"Consider the roadblocks. Bobby Lennox - so shy as a kid he was embarrassed to play football in other people's company.
John Clark - his young life ruined by the death of his father in a railway accident.
Stevie Chalmers - so sick from tuberculosis-meningitis in his late teens and early 20s that he was given three weeks to live.
Jock Stein - left his job as Celtic reserve team manager on account of his religion, the Parkhead board telling him that as a Protestant he had gone as far as he could possibly go at the club.
Stein was in tears that day. So say a number of his former players in a documentary - Glasgow 1967 - about the Lions and the city they came from, to be aired on Wednesday on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 BST.

It's part football film, part social history, part dream come true, a Cinderella tale to match any Cinderella tale the global game has ever produced. So much has been said and written about them. A quick online search shows that at least 32 books, two plays and a novel have been penned in their honour.
In this past week, the newspapers have been full of supplements, fine journalism that came at the story from new angles. There are other documentaries available, there are CDs, there's a Lisbon Lions cushion, if you fancy it, there's a Lions tea towel, a Lions iPad cover, a Lions mouse mat.
On Sunday at Celtic Park, 60,000 people created a stunning visual display that evoked their legend. On Thursday, thousands more will gather at the SSE Hydro to do it all again, this time in the company of Sir Rod Stewart, Sir Alex Ferguson, Martin O'Neill, Gordon Strachan and others.
The story never gets old, the appetite never sated.
There's a simple and lovely moment close to the beginning of Glasgow 1967 when Willie Wallace, now living in Australia, revisits Celtic Park and wanders about its corridors. ""Fifty years and they're still going on about it,"" he says with a smile on his face that spoke of pride, no doubt, but also amusement at all the fuss.
These lads didn't do fuss. They didn't consider themselves celebrities, just footballers, guys who adored the game and who were blessed with a talent and a hunger to succeed.
On that May day, Jimmy Johnstone, hot to trot, stared over at the bronzed athletes of Inter Milan as they took to the field in Lisbon and said to Bertie Auld: ""Look at them, wee man, they're like film stars!""
And Auld's answer cut to the heart of the greatness that was about to show itself. ""Aye, but can they PLAY?""
The Lions could play on a carpet and they could play on a ploughed field just as fluently. There's footage of them training on muck, not grass. That was the way of it. That was the norm. There's more footage of what tough economic times they lived in and yet amid the gloom this thing of beauty emerged.

The documentary is called Glasgow 1967 for a reason, for what shines through is the character not just of the players and their manager, but of their supporters and their city.
Humour courses through the narrative of Lisbon like a fast-running river. The emotion and the hilarity of the supporters elevates what happened to almost mythical proportions.
The fans are here in numbers. Ian Martin making a cup of tea in his kitchen and telling of the day he left for Lisbon in a Mini Cooper as part of a three-car cavalcade. ""One of the boys in the other motor lost his suitcase even before he got to Bishopbriggs. It fell off the roof-rack.""
There's Jimmy Quinn telling of an uncomfortable conversation with his fiancee. ""I said, 'See this getting married carry-on, saving up for an engagement ring an' that, I want to go to the cup final. End of story'. She wasn't a bit pleased.""
John Cowan was on a flight out of Glasgow that touched down uncomfortably close to kick-off-time. The doors of the plane swung open. The airline had no steps in place and the 19-year-old John didn't have the luxury of waiting - so he jumped.
""I sat down on the ledge and went for it,"" he recalls. ""There was guys coming behind me. Dropping, dropping, dropping. And we started running towards the terminal.""

God knows where Charlie Fryars and his mates were at this point, but Fryars' personal odyssey is a glorious illustration of the fact that, in many ways, there were more than 11 Lions in Lisbon.
Charlie tells part of his tale in the documentary, the full comic brilliance of it being told in a piece he has written for the ByTheMinute Celtic platform online. It begins when his mate, Gerry Loney, rings him up and offers him a seat in his Austin Cambridge, bound for Lisbon.
Charlie and Gerry plus Laurence Donnelly, John Hughes and Jim McDaid met at the Admiral Bar in Waterloo Street in Glasgow and hit the road. They had almost 2,000 miles to drive and three days to do it. That meant no hotel stops and as few comfort breaks as possible. Their first destination was Southampton to catch the boat to Cherbourg. They got as far as Lockerbie when the car broke down.
The explorers made the ferry, got some sleep on the four-hour crossing, drove down the Cotentin Peninsula and into Nantes where they had some beers in a bar near the station - and another kip. Not Charlie, though. Charlie was busy falling in love with a 19-year-old waitress called Ghislaine.
After half an hour, Ghislaine threw her arms around him and gave him a kiss. ""She wanted my Celtic scarf and I said to her, 'No, we need it for hanging out the window."" What greater love can one man have for his football club than to refuse to lay down his scarf for the gorgeous Ghislaine?
On they went - a thousand miles to go and only 33 hours left. Their exhaust pipe went near La Rochelle, but they got help and found a new one. They had a moment of weakness near San Sebastian, but they pulled back from the brink and carried on.
They came to the Portuguese border and it was closed for the night. The guards saw their colours and waved them through.
They made the kick-off, celebrated thunderously and then turned around and drove home. They were seven days on the road there and back, a whole week sleeping in the Austin Cambridge; unwashed, weary, but with memories that will sustain them for the rest of their lives. They didn't play that day in Lisbon, but what is that if not footballing heroism?
""When I got home,"" says Charlie, ""I got my Celtic scarf and I parcelled it up and I wrote a letter to Ghislaine at Bar de la Garde, Nantes... I never heard from her."" On that 4,000 mile trek, two happy endings was too much to hope for.
One was enough, more than enough. In this film, you marvel anew not just at what the Lions achieved, not just the lengths that 10,000 Celtic people went to in order to see them achieve it, but how powerful that achievement remains to this day, the magnitude of it passed on from father to son through the generations.
Glasgow 1967: The Lisbon Lions will be shown on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 on Wednesday 24 May. It can be seen in other parts of the United Kingdom at 23:20.","When you think about the epic sweep of the Lisbon Lions story, you have to wonder what was the greater of the miracles that happened back then - the fact that, 50 years ago, 11 local lads won the European Cup or the fact that, as a team, they existed at all."
36355458,"""Prices would go up if we leave the EU"" - David Cameron
The claim: David Cameron said on 22 May that the prices in shops would rise if we leave the EU.
Reality Check verdict: There is a consensus that Brexit would lead to a weaker pound. This would have an impact on prices over time, although it is difficult to quantify the impact precisely at this point in time.
He repeated this claim - based on the latest analysis by the Treasury - in the Peston on Sunday interview.
The Treasury says it looked into a number of external studies which estimated that leaving the EU would lead to a fall in the value of the pound of 12%.
Economists, including those in the Economists for Brexit group agree that the exchange rate would fall if the UK left the EU.
Reality Check has looked into the impact the referendum had already had on the weakening of the pound and found it was likely to be a contributing factor.
The Treasury's report used a complicated formula to calculate the impact of a weaker pound on the cost of a typical food and drink shop, as well as of clothing and footwear, for a family of four.
The ONS says an average two adult, two child household spends Â£81.40 a week on food and non-alcoholic drink, and Â£38.20 a week on clothing and footwear. The Treasury says Brexit would increase the price of food and drink for the average household by about Â£120 a year by 2018. The cost of clothing and footwear would increase by almost Â£100 over the same period.
The Treasury said it looked at the prices over a two-year period, pointing out that a weaker pound would start to have an impact on the cost of imports relatively quickly, but the effect on the consumer prices would take some time to pass through.
Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate","Writing in the Sun on Sunday, the prime minister said the cost of food and drink would rise by almost 3% if Britain left the EU, equivalent to an extra Â£120 a year for the average family, and the cost of the clothes and shoes prices would increase by 5%."
38103704,"Elsewhere there's some significant action on the committee corridor, with quite a collection of Cabinet ministers appearing before various committees.
As the current crop of bills before Parliament peters out, the committee corridor may well become the focus of attention for the coming months, particularly with 30 select committee inquiries into various Brexit-related topics now under way.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons week begins (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions - with any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions following at 3.30pm.
The main legislating is on the Digital Economy Bill, where there are some significant issues in play at report stage.
The government has accepted an important amendment from the former minister Claire Perry, who had heavyweight cross party backing for her call to add powers to the bill allowing the government to make internet service providers block porn websites that failed to comply with a requirement for age verification for their viewers.
The argument was that this was needed to give real teeth to the bill, and it has now been accepted by ministers, who're bringing in their own version of these powers, in a government amendment.
Labour, though, have reservations about the new government proposal and may even vote against it. And they argue that the best defence for children is compulsory sex education, starting at Key Stage 1, and will be pushing an amendment to that effect.
Watch out too for a Labour new clause, which seeks to create a procedure to deal with the growing problems of breaches of personal data security. This would create an obligation on data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner and those whose details had been compromised.
Labour also want to add in new laws to combat ticket touts and they will also be opposing the clauses transferring the policy over free BBC licence fees for the over-75s to the BBC, on the argument that the Corporation is not the appropriate body to take decisions on welfare policy. They plan to force that issue to a vote.
The Westminster Hall debate (4.30pm- 7.30pm) is on e-petition 162934 relating to child cancer - which calls on the government to make more funding available in the fight against child cancer.
The debate will be led by the Conservative, Ben Howlett, who said the petition had been brought by a couple whose child sadly passed away after a battle with a very rare cancer. Childhood cancer is the biggest killer by disease of children in the western world and currently the survival rates vary considerably between different types of cancer, age and gender. He wants to urge the government to do more to look at the funding for both research and testing new drugs for childhood cancer as well as new awareness campaigns aimed at parents.
Committee of the day is the Transport Committee hearing (4.05pm) on rail safety, which will ponder the issues around rising passenger numbers and problems, with the Rail Delivery Group, the Rail Safety and Standards Broad (RSSB) as well as the ASLEF, RMT and Unite trade unions.
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) peers have another day debating the Pension Schemes Bill at committee stage - key issues include more on Master Trusts and on private pension scheme exit fees.
And the Lib Dem peer, Lord Alderdice, leads a debate on ensuring parity of esteem between mental and physical health.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with Treasury questions - followed by the day's Ten Minute Rule Bill which is on Statutory Nuisance (Aircraft Noise) -  fresh from a Westminster Hall debate on this issue, Dr Tania Mathias, whose constituency lies under the Heathrow flightpath, takes her battle against a third runway to the floor of the Commons chamber.
That is followed by the second reading of the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill - a two-clause micro-measure which will raise the limit on government financial assistance that can be provided to CDC Group (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation) (the ""CDC"") to ÃÂ£6bn.
This could be a micro-second reading debate as well - leaving time for opposed private business - a number of private bills (bills dealing with a private interest) have popped up from time to time, for formal approval, only to be pulled when backbench vigilantes like Christopher Chope threaten to object to them. The aim of these challengers it to get the measures debated - and this may now occur.
In Westminster Hall, my eye was caught by the debate led by Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts, on CCTV in equine slaughterhouses (2.30pm-4pm).
My committee pick is the Justice Committee hearing (9.45pm) with Prisons Minister Sam Gyimah and Michael Spurr, Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service. The current state of the prison system can hardly be avoided. Unusually this inquiry begins, rather than ends with a hearing with a minister - and its focus could well branch out in several directions, as the hearings continue.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Public Health England and NHS officials give evidence to the Health Committee on suicide prevention and whether there is sufficient support for mental health in the NHS (2.30pm).
And there's an interesting in-house encounter - the Standards Committee hearing (10am) on the MPs' Code of Conduct and Guide to the Rules. The witnesses include the MPs' main shop stewards: Graham Brady,  Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee; John Cryer, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and Angus Robertson, Deputy Leader of the SNP; plus Bernard Jenkin, Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee; Dr Sarah Wollaston, Chair of the Health Committee, and backbench standards crusader, John Mann, one of the most active complainants on standards issues (at 10.50am).
In the Lords (2.30pm) the main debate is on the economy, in the light of the Autumn Statement.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with half an hour of Welsh questions, followed at noon by PMQs.
Then, the Labour MP Justin Madders proposes a Ten Minute Rule Bill to make it easier for young people to go to games; his Football Supporters (Access) Bill deals with ticket prices and kick off times and calls for a proportion of transfer fees to be earmarked to develop facilities for local clubs and young people.
The day's main debate will be on an SNP motion - subject to be announced - and there's an intriguing looking adjournment debate from the SNP's Gavin Newlands, on Paisley's cultural contribution to the world.
And Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green will be questioned (9.30am) by the Work and Pensions Committee about his department's finances, after the cash injection in the Autumn Statement.
My other committee pick is Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's appearance before the Environmental Audit Committee (2.20pm), to talk about the environmental concerns around Heathrow expansion and the plans to mitigate air pollution, carbon emissions and noise from a new runway.
In the Lords (3pm) the main legislation is the first report stage day on the Policing and Crime Bill - this measure will probably provide the Lords' last serious legislative clashes of 2016.
There are some big issues to be fought out.
First, behind the scenes negotiations are under way to find a compromise on the provision for Police and Crime Commissioner to take over the fire and rescue authority for their area. Labour have an amendment down to delete this entire section of the bill (Clause 6), but could well be dissuaded if the government is prepared to offer stricter requirements for local consultation on such proposals - and a new government amendment on this issue has now appeared.
Compromise is less likely on Labour amendments to prevent Special Constables using CS gas and PAVA sprays, and this may be forced to a vote. There will also be an amendment on restriction on the use of police cells for those with mental health conditions
But the biggest clash may be over an attempt to add in a requirement to hold a Leveson 2-style inquiry into relations between the police and the media - as I write, no amendment has appeared but one is expected, probably fronted by a crossbench peer, but with substantial cross party support.
If passed it would probably occasion an awkward bout of parliamentary ping-pong between Lords and Commons. And there will be plenty more controversial amendments on the next day of report stage...
As ever, on report stage days in the Lords, timing is important, and opposition amendments usually stand less chance if they're debated after the dinner break, when a lot of peers go home.
There will also be a short debate on current UK political strategy towards and plans to develop economic, security and cultural relations with Tunisia.
The Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, David Lidington, setting out what will be on the Commons agenda in the coming weeks.
The day's main debates are on subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee. First is a debate on a motion on transgender equality: Maria Miller, Angela Crawley which will follow up on the first report of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, which looked at this issue.
That's followed by a general debate on the future of the UK fishing industry. An annual fisheries debate used to be a fixture of the parliamentary calendar, but since the creation of the Backbench Business Committee, the subject has had to take its chances along with many others.
In the Lords (11am) the main debates are on options for the UK's future relationship with the EU following the referendum - led by Lord Liddle, Tony Blair's former EU advisor, and on challenges in the current system of social care, proposals for reviewing and longer-term reform - led by Labour's Baroness Pitkeathley, a former chief executive of Carers National Association (now Carers UK).
The final debate is on the EU net-neutrality Connected Continent requirements, UK adult content filtering regimes and keeping children safe online.
It's private members' bills day in the Commons (9.30am) and first up is the second reading of the SNP MP Mhairi Black's Benefit Claimants Sanctions (Required Assessment) Bill, which aims to build new safeguards into the system under which claimants can be ""fined"" if they fail, for example, to attend a job interview.
She wants the system to take into account any caring or childcare responsibilities, the mental and physical health of the claimant and their housing situation, and to ensure that any claimants who are sanctioned are made aware of any emergency funding they could access. Expect a strong turnout of SNP MPs, but there is little sign of support from the government.
Then comes the Vehicle Noise Limits (Enforcement) Bill - from the Conservative, Kevin Foster. The bill would allow noise limits to be enforced via automatic monitoring equipment.
Further down the agenda lurks Ruth Cadbury's Income Tax (Non-Military Expenditure) Bill, which would require HMRC to record income tax revenue of people who say they have a 'conscientious objection' to public spending on defence purposes and to direct their taxes that would have been spent on the military to a 'non-military security fund'.
As the third bill on the Order Paper, it has little chance of any extensive debate.
In the Lords (10am) it's the annual Friday where the bishops get to debate the subject of their choice.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, leads a debate on the ""Shared values underpinning our national life and their role in shaping public policy priorities"".
Archbishop Welby has had some pretty interesting things to say on this subject - a few extracts from a recent speech give a flavour of the ground he may cover:
""It is imperative that we remind the nation that our values have not emerged within a secular vacuum; but from the resilient and eternal structure of our Judeo-Christian theological, philosophical and ethical heritage. ....The right to life, liberty and the rule of law and robust democratic government does not come cheaply, nor is it held lightly. The roots of our freedom in this country are deeply embedded within our British constitutional and civic life because their foundation lies within the shared scriptural inheritance of our faith traditions.....Democracy is not in and of itself the final answer to things, nor is the rule of law. Martin Luther King did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law is unjust. Quite rightly, Bonhoeffer in the 1930s did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law was palpably racist, unjust and anti-Semitic. That's one of the reasons he ended up going to the gallows. As for tolerance, it's a word like 'nice', isn't it? Completely meaningless and overused. Respect is something else - I won't go there.....Our understanding of the rights and responsibilities that flow from our God-given inheritance as human beings, enable us - Jewish and Christian communities together - to be powerful and compelling advocates for freedom in British society.
""The cutting edge of freedom must include the right to disagree, disengage and dissent. It means the freedom of others to criticise us or our views, or for those of us who hold beliefs strongly to change our minds or our beliefs. It means that we all need to be accountable to one another before God and we all need to affirm the right of others to not believe as we do. What it doesn't mean is freedom without accountability to undermine each other's faith, whether casually, incidentally or wilfully. What it cannot mean is the freedom to use language destructively and negatively about those who are different to us - or who take opinions and views with which we profoundly disagree. We have had egregious examples of that in recent weeks, aimed at our judiciary. And what it must never mean is the denial of others to practise or not practise their understanding of their religious or secular identity.""","There's some important law-making afoot in both houses this week, on issues from blocking porn sites to whether special constables can use CS gas - and there could be another attempt by peers to summon the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the press, on relations between journalists and the police, back from the limbo to which is has been consigned by an unenthusiastic government."
33322443,"This is where the two powerful socio-political currents currently pulsing through Europe collide and clash.
On the one hand, you have the traditional powers that be - bankers, big business and traditional political parties, imposing their will from above.
And on the other are grassroots movements, populist and people-driven, saying a loud NO to the status quo. They are offering an alternative vision of society (in Spain, Italy and France, for example) whose workability on a national level has yet to be proven.
The two lead-roles on the Greek stage are played by the Troika (that is, Greece's international creditors - the European Commission, ECB and IMF) and left-wing Syriza, carrying its supporters in its rolled-up shirt sleeves.
The ideological abyss between them has been publicly demonstrated over the last five months and it's not diminishing with time.
Angela Merkel is the most well-known face of Greece's paymasters.
On Monday, the German chancellor repeated her belief that ""if the euro fails, Europe fails"".
But what kind of Europe is she talking about?
Acute EU dissatisfaction is a syndrome now affecting and infecting the whole continent.
High unemployment, sluggish growth, if any, a deteriorating quality of life for the majority, while the super-affluent minority continues to profit - the call for change, for a new Europe, is widespread.
Two prominent European politicians now loudly trumpet that call: the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his British counterpart, David Cameron.
But their visions for a new European dawn are quite, quite different.","As you make your way through the flag-waving, gesticulating, chanting crowds of pro and anti-government protestors here in Athens - in the lead-up to Greece's Sunday referendum on bailout conditions imposed by its international creditors -  you get the feeling that this is about something bigger than Greece's financial crisis, bigger even than the future of the eurozone."
39781954,"The sacking of ratings juggernaut Bill O'Reilly last month was the most significant departure in the modern history of American cable news. Except that is, for the departure of his boss Roger Ailes last year.
These two monumental media events - the first, a dismissal of the biggest talent on America's most influential news service; the second, a dismissal of the most influential man in American news media (after his boss, Rupert Murdoch) - have now been followed by another remarkable departure: that of Bill Shine, who ran Fox News with Ailes for two decades, and was appointed co-president to sort the mess out.
Three huge departures within nine months. There is now chatter that Sean Hannity, the senior anchor who tweeted last week that Fox News would be finished without Shine, could be the next to go.
What is going on? And could this affect UK communications regulator Ofcom's forthcoming judgement on whether to reject the Murdoch family's bid for the 61% of broadcaster Sky they don't own?
That is certainly the hope of the cross-party group of MPs who have been lobbying Ofcom, and who would rather not see the Murdochs consolidate their power here in the UK. Interestingly, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said on BBC Radio 4's World at One that Ofcom told him they were in listening mode. And there is certainly a lot of noise emanating from Fox News HQ in Manhattan right now.
There is a palpable fear in New York that the sexual harassment scandal which has toppled Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly could be an American version of the phone hacking scandal that dogged Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers. The echoes are eerie.
First, there is the instinctive blame on one rogue individual. Fox insiders have generally blamed the dominant, strongman personality of Roger Ailes for what went wrong, saying that with his departure the culture would improve. This sounds familiar to those who remember the initial claim that phone hacking was conducted by ""one rogue reporter"".
Second, there are the wider questions about a corporate culture. I don't mean by this whether or not Fox News leans to the right. I mean whether or not it is well run. Shine, who we're told resigned over the weekend, wasn't accused of sexual or racial harassment himself; but he was accused by multiple individuals of knowing plenty about the behaviour of his boss, and failing to act appropriately.
Third, and related, there are the legal investigations now under way: not one, but two. The bigger one is a federal probe looking at whether or not Fox withheld settlement payments over sexual harassment from investors.
And fourth, and worst of all for the Murdochs, there is the time. The phone hacking scandal derailed their last attempt to acquire the part of Sky which they don't already own. Now, with Ofcom's assessment of their latest takeover bid in the long grass until after the UK general election on 8 June, this huge scandal threatens to generate all the wrong headlines. The timing couldn't be worse.
For all that, it is important to note that Fox's ratings haven't suffered, and the advertising boycott that followed the revelations around O'Reilly - who strenuously denies he's done anything wrong, and is now forging a fresh career as a podcaster - hasn't yet dented Fox revenues in a really significant way.
Moreover, Fox has moved swiftly and decisively in removing toxic individuals, in a way that shows they are extremely alert to potential reputational and commercial damage. It really was unimaginable this time last year that Fox News could exist without Ailes, let alone O'Reilly and even Megyn Kelly, who is probably America's most sought after female anchor, and left the network a few months ago.
The dominant narrative in American media is that these moves show Rupert's sons, James and Lachlan, imposing their worldview on their father's media giant by decisively rejecting the orthodoxies of his reign.
In conversations with seasoned observers of Planet Murdoch, individuals at 21st Century Fox, and opponents of that company's bid for the 61% of Sky it doesn't already own, that narrative finds plenty of support.
That both Ailes and O'Reilly have gone does give credence to the idea that Fox News is being reconfigured by its parent company, 21st Century Fox, where Executive Chairman Lachlan, and CEO James - who are of equal status - want change. Since they acquired this joint status in June 2015, these two have made a concerted effort to modernise their father's firm.
They have held regular town hall meetings with staff, extended parental leave, and made a habit of sending memos to staff - whether groups or individuals - saying well done: a pillar of right-on modern management.
More importantly, they have appointed several women to key roles, from Stacey Snider (in charge of 20th Century Fox film studio) to Courteney Monroe (CEO of National Geographic, a particular passion for James). The entertainment division of 21st Century Fox has several women in key executive roles, from Elizabeth Gabler and Nancy Utley to Emma Watts and Vanessa Morrison.
Fox insiders are frustrated that the strides made in equality in the entertainment division garner much less publicity than the misdeeds of senior men in the (much smaller and less profitable) news division.
With commercial titans like Chase Carey, Peter Chernin, and now Ailes out of the picture, and James and Lachlan in the ascendant, there is a sense of a new broom at the company.
But Rupert still rules the roost. I would urge caution on those who argue that his grip is weakening. Not only was he, as you'd expect, ultimately responsible for the decisions to remove Ailes, Shine and O'Reilly; not only did he install himself as the temporary but very hands-on chairman of Fox News after Ailes left; but the idea that there was a battle of wills between father and sons, who outnumbered and outfoxed their father, is fanciful.
It is worth bearing in mind how much Rupert would have hated the New York Times felling of O'Reilly. It was their brilliant investigation that revealed the payments made to complainants against O'Reilly, causing a boycott by dozens of advertisers. Murdoch senior coveted the Grey Lady for many years, and paid a huge price for the Wall Street Journal partly because he was so determined to get one over it. The New York Times is the very embodiment of the liberal coastal elite O'Reilly, Shine and Ailes have spent decades bashing. The irony is not lost on either party.
What next for Fox News? Hannity's future remains unclear. Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who works for Fox News, told me a fortnight ago that Tucker Carlson, the anchor who has replaced O'Reilly in the key 8pm slot, has long been thought of as his likely successor. In his first few days, Carlson has rated well.
But the bigger drama is yet to come: the federal probes into whether payments were withheld from investors could intensify just as Ofcom consider whether to approve the Murdochs' bid for Sky. The last bid was of course derailed by the phone hacking scandal; and while Ofcom won't comment on what is a quasi-judicial process, their deliberations aren't taking place in a vacuum.
In ancient times, before Donald Trump was elected and when some people naively believed Hillary Clinton would be US president, the mood music coming out of New York suggested that the sons would build Fox News around Megyn Kelly, taking it in a more centrist and female-friendly direction. Now she's gone, and Rupert Murdoch is trying to rid his network of the cancer threatening to spread through it.
Suddenly, the future of Fox News is up for grabs - and British regulators are watching.","The ancient adage was never wrong, and thanks to Fox News we can now offer an update: to lose one may be considered a misfortune; to lose two is a sign something's up; but to lose three is a sign that something is rotten in America's most watched news network."
33509896,"Well the person wielding all the power in the US version of the show is Donald Trump - he with an ego the size of a medium-sized planet in our solar system, a gravity-defying mop of swirling blonde hair on his head, and a bank account that could probably refloat Greece. So what would he make of a wannabe apprentice who expressed openly racist views? And not only that - a wannabe apprentice who doesn't just want any job - he wants to be leader of the free world, the president of the United States of America.
I think he would say, with barely concealed derision and scorn ""you're fired"". But in this case Donald Trump is the wannabe, and he wants to be hired as the Republican candidate for the US presidency.
It was at his stage-managed launch held - where else - at Trump Tower in New York that he said: ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""
Immediately after those comments Republican strategists did not know whether to laugh or cry. After all, all you need do is look at the growth of the Latino population in America, assess their growing electoral importance in influencing the next presidential election, and how in the 2012 race their vote broke more or less 2:1 in favour of the Democrats, to realise that this is a group who need to be wooed and cajoled by the Republicans. But remarkably the leadership has sat on its hands, and said next to nothing. Ditto some of the other Republican candidates vying for the nomination.
I was at a breakfast this morning with one of those hopefuls, the former Pennsylvania senator, Rick Santorum, and asked him about the way Trump had expressed his views on immigration and Mexicans - all he would say is ""ah well, that's Donald...""
This stands in stark contrast to the response of corporate America. There's been little hesitation there. Giants like the department store Macy's and TV company NBC Universal have cut ties. Mexican TV companies who were to screen his Miss Universe show say they want nothing to do with him. There have been protests and demonstrations, and a celebrity Latino chef who was going to open a flagship Trump restaurant in DC has quit in horror at his comments.
So why the mismatch in response? Well, the comments from Trump have struck a chord with many Republicans. In a field that contains 15 presidential hopefuls, from nowhere Trump is almost leading the pack in the polls. Someone coined the phrase after the last presidential election that the problem with the GOP was that its support was male, pale and stale - in other words, the prominent demographic was older, white men. It's beginning to look like there is a fear of offending the core, even among some of the candidates determined to widen the appeal of the party.
And so a subject that the mainstream politicians had hoped to sidestep at this election - immigration from Mexico and countries further south - is now fair and square back in the centre of political discourse.
Of course this is a trend not unique to the USA. Look at the role Nigel Farage's UKIP played in the recent UK elections, or the Northern League in Italy, or the Front Nationale in France. If you try to ignore voter anxieties about immigration by sweeping them under the carpet, there are populist parties who will give those concerns plenty of ventilation - and win a lot of support in the process.
But Trump's appeal goes beyond any immigration concerns. Some of his supporters believe a man who has run a business so successfully can ""fix"" America's finances. And others no doubt like his blunt, straight-talking style.
Next month there is going to be a televised debate among the Republican hopefuls, mounted by Fox. To stop the show becoming totally unwieldy, only the top 10 candidates according to the five most recent polls will be invited to participate - Trump will be there. And far from backing down after the outcry his comments have provoked, he is amplifying them - or ""doubling down"" to use the American argot - and that will leave the other nine co-debaters shuffling uneasily at their podiums.
The smart money says that Trump will eventually crash and burn - a meteor that will burn super bright in the night sky, but soon to disappear in a long vapour trail.
In the meantime, somewhere in New York , a 67-year-old lady will be sitting in front of the TV, a bowl of popcorn by her side, watching Fox TV, almost splitting the seams of her pant-suit laughing.
Hillary just cannot get enough of this reality show.","If you're an aficionado of The Apprentice, you know the punchline ""you're fired"" - or when it gets to the season finale and there's the final boardroom showdown, with buttock-clenchingly tense music, long cutaway shots of the final group of hopefuls left standing, waiting nervously to hear their fate - and the man in control, the capo di tutti capi, the titan of industry announces ""you're hired!"""
36086987,"He went on to say: ""By being part of that free trade zone we would have full access to the European market but we would be free from EU regulation.""
This may be Michael Gove's hope, but it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to deliver in reality.
Assume ""the European market"" means the countries of the European continent. As Mr Gove says, excluding Russia and Belarus they are all part of a ""free trade area"" of sorts.
However, that is not one homogenous block but a mixture of agreements with varying conditions.
At its heart is the 'single market' of 28 member states of the EU.
Then there is the European Economic Area, a deal between Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and the European Union.
Switzerland has its own bi-lateral agreement with the EU because its people rejected membership of the EEA in a referendum.
Turkey is part of a customs union. Other European states included in Mr Gove's definition, like Ukraine, also have bi-lateral deals with the EU.
All have required concessions from their members in order to do a deal.
The EEA deal with the EU came in on January 1st 1994 and effectively expands the single market to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - we could call this ""full access"".
But in return they accepted EU regulations and its so-called four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
Switzerland's agreement also requires the free movement of people but has less access for the services industry, a vital part of the UK's economy.
To achieve his goal of ""full access"" but no ""EU regulation"" from Iceland to the Russian border Mr Gove would have to come to a deal with the EU, the EEA and a number of European countries outside the EU, notably Switzerland.
Stephen Booth, co-director of think tank Open Europe, said: ""The term free trade is a misnomer. What we're really talking about is preferential trade. It's about: 'You can have access to our market in return for access to yours'
""If you want preferential access the only way to do that is through a negotiation and a negotiation is a two-way street. You're not going to get something for nothing.""
We can assume a deal for ""full access"" to the EU market will be impossible without concessions on either EU regulation or the free movement of people, or both.
The German and French governments have made it clear being in the single market means free movement of people, for example.
We could have freedom from EU regulation under World Trade Organisation rules but we can expect EU tariffs on our goods - not free access.
It is perfectly reasonable to assume the EU and other European countries would want to do trade deals with the UK but there is no reason to believe the UK can expect special treatment.
Reality Check verdict: Full access with no regulation may be Mr Gove's hope but it looks impossible to deliver in practice.
READ MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate","We got an insight to the sort of trade deal the leave campaign would like to secure for Britain outside the EU this morning when Michael Gove said: ""There is a free trade zone stretching from Iceland to Turkey that all European nations have access to Ã¢â¬Â¦ after we vote to leave we will remain in this zone."""
35457661,"But Zika is no fiction.
The spread of the disease across the Americas is being described as an ""explosive pandemic"" and now Asia is on alert.
India has already started testing for the virus among its 1.3 billion population. And it will be no surprise if it is found, because India has a surprisingly long history of Zika infection.
Zika is a mosquito-borne virus which has recently been linked to shrunken brains in children and a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Scientists who have been studying the outbreak in the Americas say a couple of million people have almost certainly been infected.  The virus has been detected in 23 countries in the region and now threatens to spill into the US.
So far Asia is reckoned to be Zika-free.  Certainly all the samples analysed for the virus by the National Institute of Virology in Pune - India's centre of expertise on the spread of viral illnesses - have been negative.
But India has had Zika before.
When the Institute was first established in 1952, a group of scientists was commissioned to try to work out what diseases it should focus its efforts on.
They went out across India collecting blood samples to test for exposure to a list of 15 insect-borne diseases.  Amazingly they included Zika on the list.
I say amazingly because Zika had only just got into the spotlight.
The virus was first isolated from monkeys living in the Zika jungle of Uganda in 1947.  It was only formally described as a distinct virus in 1952.
Yet the researchers discovered that ""significant numbers"" of people had been exposed to the virus in India. A total of 33 of the 196 people tested for the new disease had immunity.
""It therefore seems certain"", they concluded in a paper published in 1953 ""that Zika virus attacks human beings in India"".
What is particularly extraordinary is that this conclusion was reached even before the first official case in a human being was registered in Nigeria in 1954.
It suggests, one expert on the spread of infectious diseases tells me, that Zika was already widespread even before that first live virus was isolated in a human.
The research team was not particularly concerned by the evidence of Zika infection.  Zika was regarded as a very mild illness causing just a slight rash and fever, and with no significant long-term complications.
That perception has changed dramatically over the last couple of months, as Zika has been linked with abnormalities in brain development in pregnancy and autoimmune illness.
Indeed, it is possible that Zika has remained endemic here but has simply not been identified because it is not routinely tested for.
And even if India does not already have Zika, the progress of two other diseases - dengue and chikungunya - demonstrates that it could spread.
All three viruses are carried by the same mosquito, the now infamous Aedes aegypti.
Just a few months ago I was out hunting Aedes aegypti in the narrow streets of Delhi's old town with a government team.
I was there because India suffered one of the worst outbreaks of dengue in its history last year.  There were 25,000 confirmed cases, but the real figure was reckoned to be at least 100 times higher.
The spread of dengue across the world has been dramatic.  The disease causes high fever and agonising joint pain.  About one in a hundred victims die.
Fifty years ago it had only ever been recorded in a couple of countries.  Now it is endemic in more than 100, putting more than half the world's population at risk.
There are reckoned to be 100 million cases of the disease a year, and perhaps as many as a million deaths.
And wherever there is dengue, one expert told the BBC, you are likely - in time - to get Zika too.
Professor Laura Rodrigues, a fellow of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says she thinks there is a real chance Aedes aegypti will re-infect Asia with the virus.
Indeed, the findings of the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) are likely to apply to Asia as well as the Americas.
It anticipates that ""Zika virus will continue to spread and will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found"".
In the meantime the race is on to try to understand how the virus works on the human body and to try to develop a vaccine.
Even the most optimistic estimates suggest that will take a minimum of two years.","It could be the plot of a dystopian thriller: the sudden outbreak of a disease that spreads almost invisibly, for which there is no cure and no vaccination, but which is linked to horrific deformity in babies and may cause some adults' immune defences to attack their own nervous systems."
